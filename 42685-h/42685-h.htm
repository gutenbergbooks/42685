<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>During the days of Old Canton, the Middle Kingdom
deigned to suffer the presence of a small number
of 'foreign barbarians' on the banks of the Choo, or
Pearl River. Their residences consisted of Factories
built expressly for them, and originally destined one for
each nationality. They were contiguous, except where
separated by three streets of narrow dimensions which
led from the suburbs of the city to the river which ran
in front of them.</p>

<p>No other port than that of Canton was open, nor
had there been one since 1745, and no foreigner was
permitted on any pretext to enter the country or even
the city outside of which he lived. The actual relations
of the Chinese Government with Western nations
consequent upon the treaties have caused such an
entire change from the old mode of transacting business,
as well as in the life then led by the few foreign
residents at Canton, that a narration of the peculiar
conditions of both (as they were) is now, as a Chinese
official would say, placed 'on record.'</p>

<h2>OLD CANTON.</h2>


<p>Even the departure of a vessel from New York for
Canton in 1824 was a rare occurrence. Neither had it
yet become fashionable to place the accent on the <i>last</i>
syllable in the name of that distant port. It would have
appeared pedantic. Years after, only, did it become <i>ton</i>!
As the ship cast off, the neighbouring wharves were
crowded with lookers-on, national and private flags were
run up to the mastheads of sea-going craft lying near.</p>

<p>Cheers were heard as she glided into the river, and
the ship 'Citizen,' Captain E. L. Keen, passed Sandy
Hook in the evening of October 9 of the above year,
bound to the Central Flowery Land. Friends and
relations who had accompanied us thus far now took
leave, and returned to the city in the pilot boat, steam
tugs not having yet come into existence.</p>

<p>The 'Citizen,' of 498 tons was one of seven ships<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
owned by Mr. Thomas H. Smith, of New York,
who had been for many years engaged in the China
trade. She had already made two voyages to Canton,
and before leaving on her present one, had been newly
coppered and 'thoroughly' overhauled, the better
to withstand the westerly gales she was likely to encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
on her return passage off the Cape of Good Hope
in the winter season. The crew consisted of thirty-two
men and boys, with two officers. One of the latter, the
second officer, as well as Captain Keen and ten or
twelve of the men, had served on board privateers in
our last war with Great Britain, while eight sailors had
just returned from a three years' cruise in the Pacific, on
board the U.S. 74 'Franklin,' Commodore Stewart. As
usual at this time with vessels bound on Eastern voyages,
the 'Citizen' was well provided with arms and ammunition&mdash;not
only for the risk of pirates in the Atlantic, to
whom her valuable cargo offered great temptation, but
from possible mishaps while passing through the Eastern
Straits.</p>

<p>The cargo consisted of 350,000 Spanish dollars in
kegs (no letters of credit on London bankers then existing),
furs, lead, bar and scrap iron, and quicksilver.
Passengers were not taken except under peculiar circumstances.
I should have been the only one, in virtue
of being destined for Mr. Smith's Factory at Canton, but
just before sailing a Scotch gentleman presented himself
at the office, and sought for a passage on board. The
letters he bore were of a high character, among them
being one from the celebrated Mr. Hume. His name
was Fullerton, and his vocation that of surgeon in the
English East India Company's service. He was allowed
to go in the ship, and proved to be a most intelligent
and amiable person.</p>

<p>He had made several voyages to India and China,
was full of anecdote and pleasant conversation, thereby
relieving the weariness of the journey. The medical
advice he most cheerfully gave rendered him a valuable
addition to us, particularly on the occasion of the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
taking fire just before making Sandalwood Island, when
one of the men was so seriously injured that his life was
despaired of for a time; but although he managed to get
back in the ship to New York, he never did a day's work
after the accident. My fellow-passenger was only known
on board as Doctor Smyth. He had come to New York
expressly to get to China in an 'out of season' vessel,
which ours was. We had no idea of the object he had in
view, and he volunteered no information. There was,
however, a little mystery in the matter.</p>

<p>On our arrival at 'Lintin' we had scarcely anchored
when my fellow-passenger took a fast<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> boat and went to
Macao. Soon after, we heard that he had there engaged
two young Chinese small-footed women to accompany
him to Calcutta, from whence he took passage with them
for England as a 'speculation.' Subsequently we learnt
that he was associated in the enterprise with Captain
C&mdash;&mdash;, also of the Honourable East India Company's
service, on board whose vessel he had filled the office of
surgeon. While in England, these 'Golden Lilies'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> had
the honour of a presentation to H.M. George IV. The
enterprise, however, was not successful. It met with
great opposition in certain quarters, and finally it ended
by those young daughters of 'Han'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> being returned to
their own country.</p>

<p>Some years after, in the winter of 1832, I last had
the pleasure of shaking hands with my old shipmate at
Canton. He was then surgeon of the Honourable Company's
ship 'Lady Melville.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>We had the misfortune to lose the ship's cook about five
o'clock on the morning of the twenty-fifth day out, when
he sprung into the sea. We had rushed on deck at the
cry of the 'cook overboard,' and heard him shout as he
passed the ship's quarter, 'You are all going to&mdash;(a most
uncomfortable place of one syllable, beginning with the
letter H), I'm going to Guadaloupe.' The ship was
instantly brought to the wind, a man sent aloft to keep
the poor fellow in sight, and a boat lowered in a trice,
but suddenly he disappeared. We resumed our course.
The crew had often been amused while about the galley
to find its 'monarch' with an open Bible in one hand,
and reading aloud from it, while prodding the salt junk
in the boiler with a 'tormentor' in the other! They
thought him a 'queer fellow,' particularly as he would
caution them as to their wickedness in blaspheming, and
their utter disregard of the future! We had heard
through the officers of those erratic ways and strange
conduct for a 'ship's cook,' but no one imagined that his
head was turned.</p>

<p>The next morning the chief officer discovered on
our starboard beam a three-masted felucca, under small
sail, standing as ourselves. It was nearly calm; presently
the 'little stranger' steered for us, manned a
certain number of sweeps, and seemed to have a great
number of men on board. She was about 140 or 150
tons burthen. While examining her with our glasses, a
sail was set on her jigger mast. There seemed to be a
general wish that she would 'come on,' in spite of what
was unmistakably a heavy swivel gun amidships. We
showed our colours, to which no reply was made. At
last we seemed to have fallen in with the traditional
'long, low, black schooner,' metamorphosed into a felucca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
for the nonce. Suddenly the man at the wheel directed
the attention of the mate to another sail just appearing
on our larboard beam; she was steering to the southward,
with a light air and under a crowd of sail. As she
approached, she proved to be a schooner of the size of
our revenue cutters. A barque also hove in sight,
bringing up a stiff squall, with heavy rain. The felucca
was next observed standing on the same course as ourselves.
We trimmed sail to the wind, and hauled up
to the eastward; presently, the wind increasing, the
schooner crossed our bows, almost within hailing distance&mdash;a
beautiful object to look at. She set all studding
sails as she went by us, with a fore skysail, and that
other unusual sail, now, perhaps, never heard of, and
then not common, called a 'ring tail.'</p>

<p>We crossed the equator on the thirty-first day out, with
a good easterly wind, which hauled to the south-east and
blew stiffly. A few days after we discovered a good-sized
barque standing in for the coast of South America.
She hoisted Brazilian colours. Her decks, forward of the
mainmast, were crowded with negroes, while abaft we
observed several dark-brown gentlemen, the captain,
officers, and supercargoes, perhaps. She was evidently
a slaver returning from the West Coast of Africa, with a
full cargo of ebony. She crossed our bows within a few
hundred yards, and on gaining our starboard side, our
dark-brown friends raised their panamas, and waving
them, wished us 'Bon voyage.' This vessel proved to
be the last 'living thing' we saw for a period of nearly
fifty days, except albatross, whales, and Mother Carey's
chickens.</p>

<p>Passing within a short distance of Tristan d'Acuna
to correct our time, we then began the long tedious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
running down 'easting.' The weather was generally
fine, with a bright sun; it was in the summer season.
Our course between 43° and 45° south latitude. The
sea ran 'mountains high,' the crest of each wave breaking
in masses of sparkling diamonds, then losing itself in
this wilderness of waters, an indescribably magnificent
sight. The ship rolled gunwale under, receiving on
board vast quantities of water, which swashed fore and
aft and from side to side, at times two or three feet deep.
Gradually this frightful chaos of warring winds and
furious seas became a matter of course, while Captain
Keen gave way to his delight in exclaiming, 'How
splendidly she behaves,' or, 'She rides the seas like a
bird;' and thus we went on, with little change, until we
made the island of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>We then steered direct for Sandalwood Island, across
a pleasant south-east trade, with nothing material occurring
until two days before sighting it.</p>

<p>After the cook had left us so abruptly for Guadaloupe,
it was arranged that the chief steward should fill
his place for the cabin, while some of the crew offered
their services for the forecastle and steerage; thus everything
went on well in this respect. Before we now made
the land, taking advantage of the fine weather and smooth
sea which prevailed, all hands were occupied in caulking
the bends and the deck, while, as had before happened,
the leak decreased. The 'officer of the kitchen' for the
day referred to was a fine young sailor about twenty-five
years of age. Being in the galley in the afternoon, about
seven bells, watching a pot of pitch being boiled, it overflowed,
and the contents fell among the burning coals.
Instead of immediately clapping on the lid, he seems to
have lost his head, and in attempting to unship the pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
from the hook it capsized, and in a moment everything
was in a blaze, burning the poor fellow so fearfully that
he had to be carried to his bunk. His lower limbs were
almost peeled, and had it not been for the presence of
the 'doctor,' he would inevitably have died.</p>

<p>We passed close to the harbour and town of 'Dilly,'
which displayed the Portuguese flag.</p>

<p>Two years before, the ship 'Ontario,' Captain
Depeyster, belonging to the owner of the 'Citizen,' called
in at Dilly for supplies on her way to Canton, and was
totally lost in coming out of the harbour.</p>

<p>The loss of the 'Ontario' gave rise to the longest
passage ever made between Whampoa and New York.
Captain Depeyster left Dilly, with the treasure saved
from the wreck of his ship, for Batavia, and there chartered
the American brig 'Pocahontas,' to carry it to
Canton. Mr. Smith's agent there rechartered her to
take as much of the proceeds of the treasure as she could
carry in teas and silks to New York, where she safely
arrived in charge of the first officer, Mr. Teel (Captain
Snow having died on the passage), close upon ten months
from Whampoa.</p>

<p>'A good full,' cries out the second mate to the man
at the wheel as a breeze springs up. A first-rate 'old
salt,' and as odd a fish, our second mate, as need be. I
have been time and again amused with the yarns he has
spun during his first watches. Of the war of 1812 he is
full of anecdotes. He is always on the dolphin-striker
when porpoises are around us, and usually strikes successfully.
Anything not done in a sailor-like fashion
excites him, and we hear him cry out, 'You'll never
be a sailor. You were not shaped for a sailor. You
were cut out to handle a musket, not a marlin-spike.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
'Sailors,' said he to me one evening, 'have their prejudices
like others; they have always a run upon
soldiers, more perhaps in joke than in earnest. A sailor
will say, "Give me a messmate before a watchmate, a
watchmate before a shipmate, a shipmate before a dog,
a dog before a marine, a marine before a soldier, a
soldier before&mdash;the devil." If you ask why a <i>marine</i> in
preference to a soldier, the answer is, because he knows
the difference between the best bower anchor and&mdash;a
"chaw of baccy!"'</p>

<p>We now steered for Dampier Straits. Having left
Booro astern, we were struck with a sudden and violent
squall, resembling more a tornado. The rain
poured down like a deluge, the rattling of the thunder
and the vividness of the lightning were frightful. Our
maintopsail-yard was snapped asunder in the slings, the
fore and mizen topsails flew into ribbons; the jib disappeared
from the bolt ropes. Each flash of lightning was
succeeded by the darkness of Erebus, while in the
midst of all, the loud voices of the officers and the replies
of the men created a turmoil such as I had never witnessed.</p>

<p>The squall was luckily of short duration; it came
upon us during the dog watch, but so intelligently did all
hands do their duty, that by midnight another maintopsail-yard
was crossed, the sail bent, the other topsails
and the jib replaced, and we were making good way
with all sail set, 'low and aloft,' including royals
and flying jib. The stars shone out with increased brilliancy,
all things had returned to a condition of perfect
quiet, so had one watch to their hammocks, and no
sound fell upon the ear save the ripple of the water under
the bows. We had noticed before, and this night particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
after the squall, a strong spicy odour, the air
seemed 'breathing an aromatic redolence.'</p>

<p>As we neared Pigeon Island, the vast and imposing
one of New Guinea being to our right, numerous canoes
came alongside. The appearance of their inmates was
singularly repulsive; the wool on the heads of these
Papuans was of so fertile a growth, that it reached a
diameter of over two feet, while from the application of
chunam, it becomes a dirty, uncertain red, hideous to
behold. By means of baskets attached to ropes, we
carried on a trade, giving in exchange for shells, plantains,
papayas, stuffed birds of paradise, and ingeniously
made baskets, everything in the shape of cast-off garments
that we could muster. It was thought a mockery
when I offered an old straw hat for a bird of paradise,
but everything seemed fish that came to their net, and
to my surprise the bucket returned with the coveted
prize. On the return of the ship to New York I sent it
home, and it proved a rare and most acceptable gift. We
anchored near Pigeon Island during the night, and the
next day entered the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>We hove to close to the Pelew Islands, to allow a
crowd of canoes to come alongside, that we might obtain
further supplies of fruit, shells, and yams, and thereby
get rid of the remainder of our old clothes. The natives
were considered as unoffensive, but this was not justified
by an attack made by them, just before we passed,
on a schooner from Java to Lintin. Her deck was
crowded with natives, who had been permitted to come
on board, and while bartering, suddenly the crew was
fallen upon and several killed, all who could taking
to the rigging. Plundering then commenced. The
'boarders' were having it their own way, but had overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the cook, who had shut himself in his galley.
Bolting one door, he suddenly commenced a liberal
distribution of hot water on the assailants, who, being
entirely naked, plunged overboard with astounding
shrieks and yells. The men aloft quickly descended.
Seizing handspikes, they were in time to cut off the
retreat of many who had been inspecting the cabin
lockers, the bodies of these were thrown overboard, a
few musket shots hastened the departure of the canoes,
and the schooner continued on her journey.</p>

<p>Our course was north-westerly, the crew employed
in putting the ship in order. After passing through the
Bashees, one of the men being over the side, to reeve the
lower studding sail tack, he tumbled overboard. The
second officer, to whose watch he belonged, threw him
a rope, which he <i>just</i> caught and was soon hauled up
on deck. 'You must have been asleep,' said Mr. Hughes,
who then asked him if the water felt warm or cold.
When the officer came in the cabin later, he exclaimed,
'That fellow wouldn't have fallen had he not been fast
asleep; but it is lucky for him he "awoke in time" to
get hold of the rope, or he would have gone down.'
This is a specimen of what 'Jack' calls 'sojer's comfort.'
They had what they called 'sailor's comfort' every
Saturday afternoon in the middle watch. It consisted in
overhauling their chests and bags, or mending their
clothes, on the system, as they said, of putting a patch
next to a patch, as being neighbourly, but never a
patch upon a patch, as that was beggarly. Many of the
men remembered, as boys, the wearing of 'pig tails,'
and their being mutually dressed, preceded by the
calling out in the 'foksle' of 'Tie for tie,' or, 'Tie me,
I'll tie you, and damn all favour.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>No happier crew were ever 'rocked upon the cradle
of the deep' than the one of which the 'Citizen' was
composed. This was the result of uniformly taut but
considerate treatment, the best of food, good grog, and
no <i>needless botheration</i>, while the utmost harmony prevailed
between Captain Keen and his officers. On the
return of the ship to Canton, on her second voyage after,
in 1827, Captain Keen related the homeward passage
of 1825, which was an unusually hard one. The ship
was forty days from point Natal to the Cape, knocked
about in the teeth of westerly gales and frightful seas,
and referring to his crew he remarked, 'No better
men ever manned a ship.'</p>

<p>We made the coast of China at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on February
11, 1825. A pilot came on board off the Lema Islands,
took us through the channel of the same name, having
to starboard the then 'terra incognita,' 'Hong Kong,'
and anchored the ship under the island of 'Lintin,' at
2 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, 125 days from New York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The island of 'Ling Ting,' or the 'Solitary Nail,'
commonly called 'Lin Tin,' was at this time the
anchorage of the 'opium store ships,' and temporarily
of vessels whose destination was Whampoa (with some
exceptions). On the arrival of an American ship, she
communicated with her agent at Canton by means of a
'fast boat,' meanwhile despatching another one to Macao
for a pilot to take her inside the river. The <i>exceptions</i>
were the ships of the English East India Company,
and country ships from India having no opium on board
(those which had anchoring at Lintin to deliver it); these
then took pilots off Macao and sailed directly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
'inner anchorage,' as Whampoa was called. The Lintin
anchorage was not, however, only an opium station. All
vessels bound to Whampoa were loaded with general
cargo, or with rice only, and were subject to what were
called Cumsha and Measurement charges. These were
very heavy in the case of the former, but moderate in
the latter. It was therefore an object for a vessel entering
the river with only part of a general cargo to fill
up with any freight that might offer, and thus reduce
the heavy charges referred to, or to send up what she
had on board, if of moderate quantity, in another ship,
then load with rice and go on to Whampoa, if she was
to load with tea for her return voyage. It almost
always happened that these arrangements could be
made, as arrivals were continually taking place with rice
cargoes or general cargoes.</p>

<p>After a week's detention at Lintin, the 'Citizen' was
directed to receive any river freight that might offer,
and proceed to Whampoa. In passing the Bogue<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Forts,
the main topsail was backed while the pilot went on
shore to exhibit his pass to the Mandarin, with whom
he returned to the ship, ostensibly to verify description
with fact; but it is unnecessary to say this had become
a mere matter of form. After a glass of wine, and
presenting the old gentleman with a few sheets of writing
paper, which, I found out afterwards, were considered
a great treat, I offered him a box of a then
recent invention, viz., friction matches; they astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him mightily, and he left us with numerous 'Chin-chin's'
and best wishes for 'good wind and good water,' equivalent
to a quick passage. We anchored abreast of French
Island on the 20th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in the year 1745 that Yung Ching, the third
Emperor of the present dynasty, ordered all foreign
trade to be confined to the port of Canton, universally
known as Whampoa. Separated by a branch of the
river from French Island stands Dane's Island. These
were so named from the privilege that those nationalities
originally enjoyed of occupying bankshalls or storehouses
upon them, wherein to shelter the crews while
smoking ship and overhauling after the desperately
long passages they must have made from Europe. All
vestiges of those buildings have long since disappeared,
but numerous decaying tombstones, half buried beneath
earth and weeds, still tell the tale. The regular tea
season being over, we found few vessels at Whampoa,
and these, as with the 'Citizen,' were designated, 'out of
season ships.' The northern side of the anchorage is
formed by the important island of Wang-Po; the river
is named the Wang-Po, and the same is applied to
the anchorage. The words mean the 'Yellow Anchorage.'
On the island is a large town of many thousand
inhabitants, almost all of whom are directly or indirectly
connected with the foreign shipping, as compradores,
stevedores, blacksmiths, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Choo, or Pearl River, commonly called the
Canton River, presented a vastly different appearance
on the 21st February, 1825, from what it did twenty
years later. It was then crowded with native vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
including those immense coasting junks which have
now almost entirely disappeared. They then made
voyages to the northern and southern ports of China,
to the Celebes, Borneo and Java, and to Singapore,
as well as to Manila. Long tiers of salt junks lined
the shore of the island of Honam; these brought cargoes
from Teenpak and places on the coast south-westward
of Macao. They were owned by a corporation of salt
merchants, who enjoyed a monopoly of the trade,
and, to prevent smuggling, a special fleet of
cruisers was organised by the local government. The
penalties against a clandestine introduction of salt were
as severe and more rigorously carried out than even
against opium. The merchants were an influential
body, as much considered as the Hong merchants, whom
they rivalled in wealth. The number of cargo boats
from the interior, of passenger boats, floating residences
and up-country craft, with Government cruisers and
flower boats, was prodigious. To these must be added
sampans,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ferry boats plying to and from Honam, and
quantities of barbers' boats, vendors of every description
of food, of clothes, of toys, and what would be called
household requirements if in shops on shore; besides
boats of fortune-tellers and of theatrical performers&mdash;in
short, imagine a city afloat, and it conveys a very
correct idea of the incessant movement, the subdued
noises, the life and gaiety of the river.</p>

<p>But now, an additional interest was added to this
floating scene, from its being the first days of the Chinese
new year. The noise of gongs, as a compliment to the
meeting of mutual acquaintances or when one boat
or junk arrived or set sail, was startling; and finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the red and gilt patches of paper, on which words
or sentences were written in large black characters,
appropriate to the opening of the new year, formed
another conspicuous feature on every kind of craft.
Ships' boats were usually furnished with paddles,
which were always brought into use from below the
Dutch Folly to the landing place in front of the
factories. The oars of our boat being therefore replaced
by them, with skill and patience, after two hours from
Whampoa, we landed at 'Jackass Point,' so memorable
in the days of old Canton. Crossing the Square, under
the guidance of Captain Keen, we entered the Suy-Hong,
and met with the kindest reception from Mr.
Jacob Covert and Oliver H. Gordon, the special agents
of Mr. Smith, and from the two younger members of the
office, John H. Grosvenor and Thomas Bloodgood.</p>

<p>Having been sent by Mr. Smith to Canton expressly
to study the Chinese language preparatory to entering
his office there, as the difficulties to be overcome in
providing a teacher for me proved insuperable, Mr.
Covert decided to send me at once to Singapore,
where a college had been commenced in which foreign
students could be received, and which might be ready
for the purpose. I went, therefore, to the Straits in
the Bombay ship 'Good Success,' Captain Poynton,
and arrived at my destination in the month of April,
after seventeen days' passage. I took letters to the
Resident, Mr. Crawford, and others, and was consigned
to Messrs. A. L. Johnston and Co. The college,
however, had not only not been finished, but there was
no prospect of its being. My friends, therefore, after
taking information from Malacca, where the Anglo-Chinese
College was in full operation, sent me there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in a small native brig. We arrived after four days'
passage from Singapore. During the two months that
I passed at Singapore I was the guest of Mr. and Mrs.
Christopher Read in their bungalow on the ascent of
Government Hill. I shall never forget the parental care
of my host and hostess. They soon caused me to forget
that I was the youngest of strangers in, to me, a most
strange land. To this day I recall their quiet and
unaffected efforts to make me at home, and the drives
they took me in their palkee gharrie. The novelty of
everything interested me; it was as if I had landed on
another planet. At that time the site occupied by
the present town of Singapore was being cleared of
its primitive jungle.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Chinese College was in every way adapted
for instruction, and I continued in it as a student of
Chinese until the end of December 1826. I then left in
the ship 'Bengal Merchant' for Canton. She was
loaded with cotton and opium, and not a fast sailer.
Captain Brown was a most pleasant and agreeable
gentleman, full of jokes and amusing stories with which
to while away the time. We anchored at Singapore,
which gave me an opportunity to see my old friends the
Reads, Mr. A. L. Johnston, and to run up to Government
House to make my salaam to Governor and Mrs.
Crawford and their nieces, being received everywhere
with a kindly welcome and the exclamation, 'How you
have grown!' Continuing on our voyage, we passed
through the Caramatta Passage, the Java Sea, Straits
of Salayer, and into the Pacific by Dampier's Straits
again. Between the Pelews and the Bashees we fell in
with a typhoon <i>au grand complet</i>. At night the sea
was as white as snow and of portentous height, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
upon us with the full uninterrupted sweep of the Pacific.
We anchored at Lintin after a passage of sixty days.</p>

<p>Mr. D. W. C. Olyphant had arrived in 1826 as the
successor of Mr. Covert; Mr. Gordon had entered the
office of Messrs. Russell and Co., No. 2 Suy-Hong.
The American Factory had been entirely built anew since
1825, and to it I betook myself. In addition to Mr.
Olyphant were Charles N. Talbot and Charles W.
King. Mr. Talbot was filling the office of U.S. Consul,
and the flag was daily hoisted in the Square in front of
the house. No. 1 Suy-Hong was occupied by James
P. Sturgis, No. 3 by John R. Latimer, and No. 4 by
John P. Cushing, T. T. Forbes, and John Hart. With Mr.
Olyphant I called on, and made the acquaintance of,
the Rev. Dr. Morrison, who had recently returned from
England. Soon after I underwent a searching examination
by him of the progress I had made in my Chinese
studies at the Malacca College, and he pronounced it
to be 'good.' There was no intention, however, that
they should be discontinued, and in a few days I was
placed under the tutorship of Le Seen-Sang. The tea
season was over; all but one or two 'out of season'
ships had sailed, but of those remaining was my old
home and 'first cradle of the deep,' the 'Citizen,'
and it was not long before Captain Keen and I again
on board at Whampoa 'fought over the battles' of our
voyage out together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The year 1827 was a dull one so far as business was
concerned, and I read Chinese with my teacher 'Le.' At
length the tea season commenced in October. When
the ships began to arrive, unpleasant news came also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
My brother, of the office of Thomas H. Smith and Son
(as it had become), wrote me that 'difficulties' existed
in the affairs of the house. Finally it stopped payment
and went into liquidation, but from causes not attributable
to its China business. The Canton agency had
therefore to be closed. Consulting with Mr. Olyphant
in regard to myself, he advised me to return to New
York, where only my position could be arranged. As
usual at the time of which I write, certain indentures
between employers and <i>employés</i> were usually drawn
up. They existed between Mr. Smith and myself. In
them, he engaged to send me to China for the purpose
of acquiring the Chinese language, and then to be
employed in his Factory at Canton, as clerk or Factor,
and I was to render him service until I should have
reached the age of twenty-one. It was a long time for
me to look forward to in 1827. Several ships of the
New York house were loading which had arrived in
regular course before insurmountable difficulties had
occurred. Amongst them was the 'Mary Lord,' Captain
Rosseter. I left in her and arrived in a good run of
120 days. My fellow-passenger was Mr. Daniel
Stansbury, whose name has become identified with the
American trade at Canton from his having been the
inventor of a measuring rod, by which cargoes were
ever after measured. It proved to be an instrument
of wonderful accuracy and rapidity, simple in the
extreme, as well as the most convenient that can be
imagined. 'Stansbury's measuring rod,' now proverbial,
dates from our last war with Great Britain, 1812, when
the inventor, being at Canton, and business with the
United States suspended for some time, in his days of
forced idleness he conceived the actual mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
measuring cargoes, which up to that time had been
measured with the foot rule!</p>

<p>My interviews with Mr. George W. Bruen, the partner
of Mr. Smith, led to no other result than the cancelling
of the indentures, without indemnity. Not long after
Mr. D. W. C. Olyphant himself returned to New York,
leaving Messrs. Talbot and King at Canton, with the
view of establishing a house there of his own. His first
purchase was a very fine ship named the 'Roman,'
Captain Lavender, of about 500 tons. He offered me a
passage out in her, for the <i>chance</i> of being employed in
the new house, which afterwards occupied for a great
many years so distinguished a position in the commercial
community in China. I accepted the <i>chance</i> and
sailed in the 'Roman' in October. We were in all six
passengers. The father and brother of Mr. Charles N.
Talbot going out for the trip; Mr. Talbot, senior, had
already been to Canton in 1802 or 1803. Two of the
others were the Rev. E. C. Bridgman and the Rev.
David Abeel. They were the first American missionaries
to the Chinese. The former became one of
the most accomplished Sinalogues of the day (which I
<i>do not</i> attribute to my having given to both these
gentlemen daily lessons on the passage out!), while Mr.
Abeel was the <i>first</i> United States Consul appointed at
<i>any</i> port north of Canton, being commissioned to
Amoy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We sailed in October, and anchored at Lintin in
February, <i>viâ</i> Dampier's Straits, in 134 days. I was
received by Mr. Talbot, who, from the yet uncertain
advices from New York as regarded future business,
could hold out no encouragement for me of office work;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but, failing any other house, I was always welcome to
a return passage in the 'Roman.' There were very few
American houses then in Canton, and they were
Agencies; moreover, they seemed provided with
youngsters, and I accordingly prepared to leave again
for New York. Meanwhile, however, Mr. Talbot busied
himself on my behalf, but the stay of the 'Roman' was
short and she was soon to be despatched. There appeared
absolutely nothing to be done. A few days before
the ship sailed, while in my room, occupied with my
luggage, one of the Chinese servants came to me, and
said, 'Mr. Talbot chin-chin you come down.' I went
accordingly, and was introduced to Mr. Samuel Russell,
the chief of the house of Russell &amp; Co. He had heard, he
said, from Mr. Talbot, of my probable return home in
the 'Roman,' and had come to invite me to his office.
I accepted the offer, and in the evening I was duly
installed at No. 2 Suy-Hong. This was on March 24,
1829, and it became my uninterrupted home until
December 31, 1842.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The word 'Factory' was an importation from India,
where the commercial establishments of the 'East India
Company' were so designated, and synonymous with
'agency.' It is well to explain this, as it is now being
confounded with 'manufactory.'</p>

<p>The space occupied by the foreign community at
Canton was about 300 feet from the banks of the
Pearl River, eighty miles from Macao, sixty miles
from Lintin, forty miles from the Bogue Forts, and ten
miles from the Whampoa anchorage. In breadth from
east to west it was about 1,000 feet. On it stood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Factories, which comprised the dwellings and places of
business of each nation originally under one roof. The
line of frontage was uniform, all looking due south.
The distinction of <i>new</i> given to <i>one</i> of the two buildings
occupied by the 'Company' applied to that one which
was rebuilt after the great fire of 1822, which destroyed
all the others, with a few exceptions, as well as, according
to official accounts, '12,000 Chinese houses, shops,
and temples in the western suburb.' Each Factory consisted
of a succession of buildings, behind one another,
separated by narrow spaces or courts, and running
north. The front ones were numbered 1, those back
of them, nearly all of three stories, No. 2, 3, and so
on. The least numerous Factories were then in the
American Hong, the greatest number were in the
Danish and Dutch Hongs, which contained seven and
eight respectively.</p>

<p>The Chinese word 'Hong' was applied to any place
of business, but was more particularly used to designate
the Hongs of the 'Security Merchants' whence Hong
Merchants or any foreign Factory in its entirety. It
signifies a row of buildings. By the Chinese, the places of
business of foreigners were known as 'Foreign Hongs;'
those of the Security Merchants as 'Foreign Hong Merchants.'</p>

<p>Beginning at the west, stood the Danish Factory;
adjoining it were Chinese shops in its whole length,
forming New China Street, which here intervened,
separating it from the Spanish. Next the French, and
by its side in its whole length, that of the Hong Merchant
Chungqua; Old China Street here came in, and
against it was the American, then the Imperial, by its
side the Paou-shun, next in order the Swedish, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
English, and then the Chow-Chow.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Now came a small
narrow lane, the renowned Hog Lane, most appropriately
named. The high walls of the new English Factory
bordered the lane, having as next neighbour eastward
the Dutch, and next to this stood the Creek Factory.
The latter took its name from a small creek, which,
running down along the walls of the city, here emptied
into the river. Originally this creek formed the ditch of
the west side of the city.</p>

<p>The entire number of buildings, therefore, was
thirteen. Immediately in their rear, and running east
and west, was a long, narrow, but important street,
named 'Thirteen Factory Street.'</p>

<p>From the front of the new English a long broad
terrace projected towards the river, its columns supporting
an entablature, whose pediment bore the arms of
England with the substitute of 'Pro Regis et Senatus
Angliæ' for 'Honi soit qui mal y pense.' The Dutch
company ('Maatschappay') possessed a similar terrace,
with the national arms and motto 'Je maintiendrai.'
These two, the English and Dutch Companies, were
the direct successors of those founded on December 31,
1600, and in 1602 respectively. The English Jack, the
Dutch, the United States, and the Spanish flags, were
daily, in 1825, hoisted before those respective Factories,
and were visible from a great distance. The Spanish
flag represented the Philippine Company. The French
flag was hoisted on December 13, 1832, after an interval
of thirty years; it denoted simply the Canton residence
of the Consul, as the trade of that country was insignificant,
while the Swedish, Danish, and Imperial (Austrian)
direct commerce had ceased, and no other Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
nation traded directly with Canton. Portugal was confined
in her commercial relations to her own colony of
Macao; Russia to Kiachkta. From the port of Cha-po,
on the east coast of China, two junks sailed annually to
Nagasaki. Siamese vessels would occasionally be seen
at Whampoa, when conveying tribute bearers on their
way to Pekin, and not far from the Factories was the
residence of the Ambassadors.</p>

<p>At the northern extremity of Old China Street, and
facing it, stood an extensive and handsomely built series
of buildings, in the Chinese style, called the 'Consoo'
House, or 'Council Hall of the Foreign Factories.' It
contained numerous suites of rooms for receptions and
business, with open courtyards, and was always kept in
excellent order and cleanliness by the Chinese in charge.
It was the property of the Hong merchants collectively,
and was maintained by funds appropriated by them
for the purpose. When any event bearing upon the
foreign trade required it, such as new regulations, or confirming
old ones, or a revision of duties, the 'Tai pans'
or <i>Chiefs of Houses</i> would be invited to meet the Hong
merchants and discuss the subject. Any foreigner went
if inclined, and would occasionally learn of many
official acts, having a bearing upon business, and even
upon his daily walks or boat-pulling on the river, which
may have come under the notice of the authorities, who
would have suggested shorter journeys or the exercise
of care from collisions. It was also in the Consoo
House that the Hong merchants met, or a committee
of them, in the rare cases of bankruptcy or pecuniary
difficulties of one of their number, and it was the
depository of books of accounts relative thereto, as well
as of records of meetings. The entrance to it was by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
flight of broad granite steps, through large heavy folding
doors of a highly polished and valuable wood.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Being a
handsome specimen of this style of Chinese architecture,
foreign visitors to Canton were taken to see it as one of
the sights.</p>

<p>The Factories were the individual property of the
Hong merchants, and were hired of them. By law, no
women were permitted to enter them, nor were guns,
muskets, powder, or military weapons allowed to be
brought within the gates. Entrance to the rear Factories
was by arched passages running through those in front.
The lower floors were occupied by counting-rooms, go-downs,
and store-rooms, by the rooms of the Compradore,
his assistants, servants and coolies, as well as by a
massively built treasury of granite, with iron doors, an
essential feature, there being no banks in existence. In
front of each treasury was a well-paved open space,
with table for scales and weights, the indispensable
adjuncts of all money transactions, as receipts and payments
were made by weight only, except in some
peculiar case. The second floor was devoted to dining
and sitting rooms, the third to bedrooms. As almost
all were provided with broad verandahs and the buildings
put up with care, they were quite comfortable,
although in every respect devoid of ornamental work.
In front of the middle Factories between Old China Street
and Hog Lane ran a broad stone pavement, and this
bordered an open space running down to the banks of
the river, a distance of about three hundred feet. On
the east side it was bounded by the wall of the East
India Company's landing place and enclosure, and on
the west by the wall in front of the landing and enclosure
of Chungqua's Hong. The Chinese were prohibited
from loitering about this 'Square,' as it was called. On
the corner of Old China Street and the American Hong
stood a guard-house with ten or a dozen Chinese soldiers,
acting as police to prevent disturbance or annoyance to
the 'foreign devils.' On the edge of the river, facing the
'Pow Shun' and the Creek Hongs were 'Chop' houses,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
or branches of the Hoppo's department, whose <i>duty</i> it
was to prevent smuggling, but whose <i>interest</i> it was to
aid and facilitate the shipping off of silks (or the landing
of cloths) at a considerable reduction from the Imperial
tariff. A few pleasant words, accompanied by a fee, would
secure a permit for the boat of the 'Wandering Eagle'
to be allowed to pass all revenue cruisers 'without
molestation' on her way to Whampoa.</p>

<p>The words Factory and Hong were interchangeable,
although not identical. The former, as will have been
seen, consisted of dwellings and offices combined. The
latter not only contained numerous offices for <i>employés</i>,
cooks, messengers, weighmasters, &amp;c., but were of vast extent,
and capable of receiving an entire ship's cargo, as well
as quantities of teas and silk. When speaking of their
own residences, foreigners generally used the word
'Factories;' when of a Hong merchant's place of
business, the word Hong. The Swedish Factory, however,
seemed to enjoy the distinction of going by its
Chinese appellation, viz. 'Suy-Hong.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I have been thus specific in the description of these
world-renowned Factories, as they were subsequently
razed to the ground consequent upon Sir Michael Seymour's
bombardment of the city of Canton. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
last visited the site, nearly thirty-five years after I first
took up my residence in them, it was literally unrecognisable.
It presented a scene, the desolation of
desolation; there remained not one stone upon another!
For more than one hundred years they had formed the
sole residence of foreigners within the limits of the vast
Chinese Empire. The business transacted within their
walls was incalculable, and I think I am safe in
saying that from the novelty of the life, the social
good feeling and unbounded hospitality always mutually
existing; from the facility of all dealings with the
Chinese who were assigned to transact business with
us, together with their proverbial honesty, combined
with a sense of perfect security to person and property,
scarcely a resident of any lengthened time, in
short, any 'Old Canton,' but finally left them with
regret.</p>

<p>In no part of the world could the authorities have
exercised a more vigilant care over the personal safety
of strangers who of their own free will came to live in
the midst of a population whose customs and prejudices
were so opposed to everything foreign, and yet the
Chinese Government was bound by no treaty obligations
to <i>specially</i> provide protection for them. They
dwelt at Canton purely on sufferance. Neither Consul
nor any other official representative from abroad was
directly acknowledged as such, and yet the solicitude
of the local government never flagged. In addition to
the guards always posted at the corner of the American
Hong and Old China Street, others were stationed in
various directions in the suburbs frequented by foreigners,
in order that any Chinese who might be troublesome
could be driven off, or that they could escort back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the factories those who were uncertain of their whereabouts.</p>

<p>During the north-east monsoon fires were quite frequent
in the densely populated suburbs lying north of
the factories. When they threatened the foreign quarter
the Hong merchants, acting in consonance with the
known wishes of the Mandarins, would send gangs of
armed coolies to assist in the removal to boats provided
by them of books, papers, treasure, and personal effects.
All strange Chinese would be ruthlessly driven from
the Square, and an unobstructed passage to the boats
secured. I have witnessed this repeatedly. Should
a foreigner get into a disturbance in the street, and it
was generally safe to say it was through his own fault,
the Chinamen went to the wall. When a mob of many
thousand ruffians invaded the Factory Square, as in
November 1838, shortly preceding the opium surrender,
and with stones and missiles of all sorts drove the
foreigners inside their gates, which they were forced
to barricade, a not unnatural anxiety prevailed amongst
us as to what might be the result. Yet this attack was
<i>caused by foreigners, who interfered with the Mandarins</i>
while attempting to carry out Government orders.</p>

<p>All foreigners who came to Canton, from the first
arrivals, were considered as having no other object than
that of commerce. The English and the Dutch made their
appearance in the first half of the seventeenth century;
successively arrived, the Danes, Swedes, and Austrians
(Imperialists). The Spaniards invited the Chinese to
their new settlement at Manila for a time, and afterwards
they themselves came to the provincial city.</p>

<p>Some amongst these different nationalities, tradition
said the Dutch, had <i>red hair</i>, which led the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
facetiously to apply the term 'Red-headed Devils' ever
after to all foreigners alike. They themselves give to
the whole of their own race the name of 'Black Hair'd.'</p>

<p>The authorities framed eight regulations for the
especial government and control of these divers people
from afar. They date from the year 1760, and are
curious enough to recall. Never having been abrogated,
they were assumed to be in force always. They were
confirmed by an edict of the Emperor Kea-King in 1819,
after a revision in 1810. Some of them came to be disregarded
by the foreign community, particularly those referring
to the Gardens, the Honam Temple, and pulling
in their own boats on the river; but so far as regards
women entering the Factories, an infringement of them in
this essential particular took place in 1830, as will be
seen hereafter. The chief sufferers in the event of a
disregard of any important item of the regulations
would of course be the Hong merchants. The 'Eight
Regulations' were now and then brought to the Factories
by a Linguist, as an intimation that they were not to be
considered a 'dead letter.' Translated into English they
read thus&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Regulation 1.</i>&mdash;All vessels of war are prohibited from entering
the Bogue. Vessels of war acting as convoy to merchantmen
must anchor outside at Sea till their merchant-ships
are ready to depart, and then sail away with them.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 2.</i>&mdash;Neither women, guns, spears, nor arms of
any kind can be brought to the Factories.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 3.</i>&mdash;All river-pilots and ships' Compradores must
be registered at the office of the 'Tung-Che'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at Macao. That
officer will also furnish each one of them with a licence, or
badge, which must be worn around the waist. He must produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>it whenever called for. All other boatmen and people
must not have communication with foreigners, unless under
the immediate control of the ships' Compradores; and should
smuggling take place, the Compradore<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of the ship engaged in
it will be punished.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 4.</i>&mdash;Each Factory is restricted for its service to
8 Chinese (irrespective of the number of its occupants), say 2
porters, 4 water-carriers, 1 person to take care of goods ('go-down
coolie'), and 1 mā-chen (intended for the foreign word
'merchant'), who originally performed all the duties of the
'House Compradore,' as he is styled to-day.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 5</i> prohibits foreigners from rowing about the
river in their own boats for 'pleasure.' On the 8th, 18th, and
28th days of the moon 'they may take the air,' as fixed by the
Government in the 21st year of Kea-King (1819). All ships'
boats passing the Custom-houses on the river must be detained
and examined, to guard against guns, swords, or firearms
being furtively carried in them. On the 8th, 18th, and 28th
days of the moon these foreign barbarians may visit the Flower
Gardens and the Honam Joss-house,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but not in <i>droves</i> of over
ten at one time. When they have 'refreshed' they must return
to the Factories, not be allowed to pass the night 'out,' or
collect together to carouse. Should they do so, then, when
the next 'holiday' comes, they shall not be permitted to go.
If the ten should presume to enter villages, public places, or
bazaars, punishment will be inflicted upon the <i>Linguist</i> who
accompanies them.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 6.</i>&mdash;Foreigners are not allowed to present petitions.
If they have anything to represent, it must be done
through the Hong merchants.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 7.</i>&mdash;Hong merchants are not to owe debts to
foreigners. Smuggling goods to and from the city is prohibited.</p>

<p><i>Regulation 8.</i>&mdash;Foreign ships arriving with merchandise
must not loiter about outside the river; they must come direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>to Whampoa. They must not rove about the bays at pleasure
and sell to rascally natives goods subject to duty, that these
may smuggle them, and thereby defraud His Celestial Majesty's
revenue.</p></blockquote>

<p>Originally there existed two English East India Companies,
the oldest of which was incorporated in 1579. In
the year 1600 they amalgamated, and received a charter
from Queen Elizabeth. At the same time they assumed
the title of the 'United East India Company,' and as a
trade-mark, a heart with two transverse bars, bearing in
the four divisions thus formed the letters V. E. I. C.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 172px;">
<img src="images/emblem.jpg" width="172" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This trade-mark had acquired such a well-merited reputation
at Canton, that it was considered unnecessary to
examine any package of merchandise that bore it. A
simple exhibition of musters was made, when transactions
were concluded, and the original packages forwarded unopened
to all parts of the Empire. The Company's vessels
first arrived at Canton between 1650 and 1660, and
tea was first used in England in 1666.</p>

<p>By the Chinese the Company was known as Kung-Se,
the characters signify 'United Affairs.' By the Canton
community its representatives collectively were universally
referred to as 'The Factory.' They were much more
numerous than the members of any other establishment.
In 1825, the 'Factory' consisted of Sir James Urmston,
chief; Messrs. W. H. C. Plowden, Marjoribanks, and
J. F. Davis, of whom two, with the chief, formed a
select committee; of writers (as usually called) there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
were about twenty; an inspector of teas, Mr. Reeves;
chaplain, the Rev. R. H. Vachell; surgeons, Pierson
and Colledge; and an interpreter, the Rev. Dr.
Robert Morrison.</p>

<p>The 'Factory' entertained with unbounded hospitality
and in a princely style. Their dining-room was of vast
dimensions, opening upon the terrace overlooking the
river. On the left was a library, amply stocked, the
librarian of which was Dr. Pierson; on the right a
billiard room. At one extremity of the dining-room
was a life-size portrait of George IV. in royal robes,
with crown and sceptre, the same that had been taken
by the Embassy of Lord Amherst to Pekin, offered to
and refused by the Emperor Keen-Lung, and brought to
Canton overland. Opposite to it hung a smaller full-length
portrait of Lord Amherst.</p>

<p>From the ceiling depended a row of huge chandeliers,
with wax lights, the table bore candelabra, reflecting a
choice service amidst quantities of silver plate.</p>

<p>I was glad to have witnessed this sight, unique in
that distant quarter of the world, to reach which the old
adage would apply, 'it was not every one who could get
to Corinth.' Soon after I landed at Canton, I had the
honour of a first invitation to dine with the 'Factory'
and must confess that at my then age I accepted it
with fear and trepidation. One of the <i>invité</i> from the
Suy-Hong, Mr. Oliver H. Gordon, accompanied me.
Our way led through the great outer gate, past the
'chapel' whose spire bore conspicuously a large clock,
the only one in Canton, and by which everyone regulated
his watch; then up a broad flight of stone steps to a
verandah, crossing which one entered the library and
reception room as well. When the hosts and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
guests had assembled, large folding doors were opened
and we entered the noble dining-room, whose brilliancy
and cheerfulness and gorgeously furnished table I see
<i>now</i>. At the remote end of the room were grouped the
Chinese servants of the Factory and of the guests, in
caps and long robes, who immediately took up their
places behind their respective masters as soon as seated.</p>

<p>About thirty gentlemen were present, including Mr.
Bletterman, chief of the 'Maatschappay;'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Mr. Hollingworth
Magniac, of the 'licensed' house of Magniac &amp;
Co. (predecessors of the present firm of Jardine, Matheson,
&amp; Co.); Mr. Thomas Dent, of another 'licensed' firm,
Thomas Dent &amp; Co.; and several of my own countrymen,
including Mr. Benjamin C. Wilcox and John R.
Latimer.</p>

<p>But the days of the Honourable East India Company
were now unconsciously drawing to an end. It
had existed for 250 years! It ceased as a 'commercial'
body in 1833. Many members of the 'Factory'
were then removed to India and there took up civil
appointments. Messrs. Astell and Clarke alone remained
at Canton to close up outstanding affairs, and
finally left in December 1839. Twenty-five more years
were accorded to the Company after 1833 to transfer to
the Crown the splendid empire those enterprising merchants
had founded in India, and in 1858 its sun set&mdash;politically.</p>

<p>Few now remain who witnessed the final breaking
up and departure of 'the Factory' from Canton; personally,
there was much regret, as it had always been a
marked feature in the community. The 'Outside'
Merchants, unshackled from licenses, hailed it as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
auspicious day, opening up to them visions of prosperity,
which soon assumed the form and substance of reality.
As an event to be placed 'on record' as the Chinese
say, the first 'free ship' with 'free teas' was loaded at
Whampoa and despatched for London on March 22,
1834, by the still existing house of Messrs. Jardine,
Matheson, &amp; Co. The vessel was named the 'Sarah,'
Captain Whiteside.</p>

<p>The principal teas shipped by the Company were
Bohea and Congo. One may judge of their qualities
by their selling in England from 'two shillings and sixpence
up to sixty shillings per pound, while sound
common Congo is selling to-day at sixpence farthing'!
(Messrs. J. C. Sillar &amp; Co's tea circular of February,
1881.) The Company imported English-made
woollens and cottons and raw cotton from India. The
most important of the licensed houses in 1825 were
Magniac &amp; Co., Thomas Dent &amp; Co., Ilberry, Fearon
&amp; Co., Whiteman &amp; Co., and Robertson, Cullen, &amp;
Co. (Colonel Fearon, who commanded the detachment of
troops on board the East India Company's ship 'Kent,'
burnt in the Bay of Biscay, 1825, on her way to Calcutta,
was a brother of the Mr. Fearon just named.) Their transactions
were with India, and in the aggregate on a very
extensive scale. They received raw cotton from the three
Presidencies; opium from Bombay and Calcutta; rice,
pepper, tin, &amp;c., from the Straits of Malacca. The local
name for their business was the 'Country Trade' the ships
were 'Country Ships' and the masters of them 'Country
Captains.' Some of my readers may recall a dish
which was often placed before us, when dining on board
these vessels at Whampoa, viz., 'Country Captain.' The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ships were 'Country' built as well, and of teak; they
were not fast sailers, but comfortable and substantial.
They made one voyage annually, rolling up the China
Sea before the south-west monsoon and rolling down
again with the north-east. Some of them, as the 'Sulimany,'
the 'Fort William,' the 'Futty Salaam,' were
not far from their eightieth birthday.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Hong merchants (collectively, the Co-Hong) as
a body corporate date from 1720. From that year,
except for a short interval before 1725, they were
the monopolists of the foreign trade. The principal
ones, in 1825, were Houqua, Mouqua, Pwankeiqua,
Pwansuylan, Chungqua, Kingqua, and Gouqua. The
affix <i>qua</i>, which is usually supposed to be a part of the
name, is simply a term of civility or respect, and is
equivalent to Mister or Sir. The word means literally
to 'manage' or 'control.' The number of the 'Co-Hong'
was limited to thirteen.</p>

<p>Their establishments commenced on the creek
already referred to, and extended eastward on the riverside,
whereby the shipping off and landing of cargo
were attended with great facilities. They were the
'warehouses' in which were received all the teas and
silk from the interior, and in which these articles were
repacked, if necessary, weighed, matted, and marked,
before being sent to the ships at Whampoa. The boats
in which they were conveyed were of a peculiar build,
with circular decks and sides, and from their resemblance
to a melon they were called 'water-melons' by the
Chinese, but by foreigners they were always referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as 'chop-boats.' They were of the capacity of 500 chests
of tea, or 500 piculs of weight. The orderly and intelligent
despatch of business at the Hongs was characteristic
of the Chinese, as were the neatness of all packages and
the dexterity with which they were handled.</p>

<p>The Hong merchants were the only ones officially
recognised by the Government, and no goods bought of
'outside' Chinese could be shipped off except through
one or the other of the 'Hongs,' which received thereon
a tax, and in whose name they were reported to the
Hoppo. The 'outside' merchants had, however, become
of great importance, their transactions were on an immense
scale annually. As manufacturers of silks, of
floor-matting, nankeens, crapes, grass-cloth, and a host
of less important articles, many of them had amassed
great wealth; at the same time, they were always assumed,
officially, as confining themselves strictly to such
things as were necessary for the 'personal use' of foreign
residents. In fact, it was 'custom' from time to time
for the authorities to remind them of this, and even to
enumerate the things which they were only allowed
to furnish. As a curiosity they may be recorded&mdash;clothing,
umbrellas, straw hats, fans, shoes, and so on!</p>

<p>The Hong merchants were responsible to the Hoppo
for the duties on all exports and imports. They alone
transacted business with that officer's department&mdash;viz.,
the 'Customs'&mdash;by which foreigners were spared trouble
and inconvenience. It may be as well to mention here
that the 'Hoppo' (as he was incorrectly styled) filled
an office especially created for the foreign trade at
Canton. He received his appointment from the
Emperor himself, and took rank with the first officers
of the province. The Board of Revenue is in Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
'Hoo-poo' and the office was locally misapplied to the
officer in question.</p>

<p>As controllers of the entire foreign commerce of the
port of Canton, which amounted annually to many
millions of dollars, if the benefits derived therefrom were
of vast importance, the responsibilities were also great.
For infractions of 'regulations' by a ship or by her
agents they were liable. It was assumed that they
could, or should, control foreigners residing in the
Factories as well as the vessels anchored at Whampoa.
In both cases they were required to 'secure' due 'obedience.'
Every resident therefore had his 'sponsor' from
the moment of landing, as every ship had hers, and
hence the Hong merchants became 'security merchants.'
My own was Houqua, who of course represented some
others also, and in view of these mutual relationships
we would jocularly call them 'our horse godfathers.'</p>

<p>The purchases of the East India Company were
divided amongst the Hong merchants proportionately,
in shares, of which fourteen fell to the lot of Houqua.</p>

<p>The position of Hong merchant was obtained
through the payment of large sums of money at Pekin.
I have heard of as much as 200,000 taels, say 55,000<i>l.</i>
sterling. If the 'license' thus acquired was costly, it
secured to them uninterrupted and extraordinary pecuniary
advantages; but, on the other hand, it subjected
them to calls or 'squeezes' for contributions to public
works or buildings, for the relief of districts suffering
from a scarcity of rice, as well as for the often imaginary
or over-estimated damage caused by the overflowing of
the 'Yang-tsze-Keang' or the 'Yellow River.'</p>

<p>'Well, Houqua,' you would say on some visit, 'hav
got news to-day?' 'Hav got too muchee bad news,' he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
would reply; 'Hwang Ho hav spilum too muchee' That
sounded ominously. 'Man-ta-le<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> hav come see you?'
'He no come see my, he sendee come one piece "chop."
He come to-mollo. He wantchee my two-lac<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> dollar.'
It was the old complaint, a 'squeeze' and this time a
formidable one. 'You pay he how mutchee?' 'My
pay he fitty, sikky tousand so.' 'But s'pose he no
contentee?' 'S'pose he, N<sup>o.</sup> 1, no contentee, my
pay he one lac.' This actual incident will show the
sort of demands upon the senior Hong merchant (each
one being called upon in his turn) and their pecuniary
importance. They knew at the same time that the
object of the 'squeeze' was exaggerated, and, even if
necessary, that only a modest portion would go to the
repairs of the banks of the river, the mandarin thinking
that his own personal wants were far more pressing.
They might try to parry the question, they might
succeed in getting the sum asked for diminished, but
they could not escape. Payments would also be made
by them to the Hoppo on the occasion of his return to
Pekin, on the appointment of a successor, as well as to
the chiefs of the Revenue Board in that capital; but
such as these had a <i>raison d'être</i>, they secured influence
and protection, and besides, the sums paid were voluntary
and comparatively moderate in amount.</p>

<p>As it added to their dignity and privileges, the
Hong merchants purchased nominal rank, the insignia
of which was denoted by a button or coloured globe
attached to the apex of the cap. Of this they might
be deprived for offences against the law or for bankruptcy;
then a wearer of it in local parlance would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
'unbuttoned,' or deprived of this significant emblem of
his social and public status.</p>

<p>The occupation of a 'merchant' in China is looked
down upon by wealthy landed proprietors, by the
<i>literati</i>, and by those who have risen to official rank
through their own talents; but bankruptcy is considered
degrading and even criminal.</p>

<p>Bankrupts are first deprived of any nominal rank
they may possess before being so adjudged by law.
Previous to my arrival at Canton one case of a bankrupt
Hong merchant had taken place. The penalty for a
member of the Co-Hong was transportation to E-Lee.
Only one other occurred during the remainder of the
period of the existence of the Co-Hong. The last
exiled bankrupt was Mān-Hŏ. He had been a general
favourite with the foreign community, was a person of
courteous manners, and in every respect a well-bred and
kindly man. He had borne on his cap the 'blue
button' which denoted the third rank&mdash;principal&mdash;and it
gave him the privilege of a certain title on his cards, &amp;c.
The books and affairs of his Hong passed into the
charge of the Co-Hong for examination, the result
proved most unsatisfactory, and when it was laid
before the Hoppo he was declared bankrupt, and sentenced
to transportation for life to E-Lee (the present
Kuldja), on the north-west frontier. It is commonly
spoken of by the Canton Chinese as the 'Colo'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> country.
Few know its geographical position. Preparations
having been made for his departure, at a moment when
some officials were leaving for that remote province,
Mān-Hŏ, with other condemned persons, was placed
under their charge. The boats, having all these on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
board, anchored off the Factories. Many of his old
Chinese and foreign friends went on board to say goodbye.
One of the latter handed him a letter, in which was
expressed sympathy for his misfortunes. And it added
that a sum of money, subscribed by the Hong merchants
and themselves for his personal comfort, had been placed
with reliable servants of his own, who were accompanying
him of their own accord. Neither the Government nor
the Hoppo objects to such aid being rendered by relations
and friends to one who by misfortune or bad management
has incurred the penalty of the law, if not excessive.
In the present case the amount was 10,000 dollars.</p>

<p>In a few hours after, the convoy left on one of the
most dreary journeys that can be imagined. It occupied
several months, involving constant transhipment to other
boats, now over execrable roads in the most comfortless
of bamboo chairs, then on pony back, and frequently on
foot.</p>

<p>A very long time after his departure we heard, by
the return of one of his servants, that Mān-hŏ had been
at first set to work as 'sweeper' in a temple, which he
was able to compromise into a purely nominal 'office.'
Again, that he had managed to get about him sundry
comforts, such as E-Lee possessed, which is saying very
little. Years passed, when we at once heard of his death
and of the arrival of the body at Canton (in charge of
the servants who had remained with him) for interment
in his native place.</p>

<p>After Mān-hŏ left Canton I saw, in the hands of one
of the above foreign contributors, his promissory note
for $60,000, bearing interest at 5 per cent. per month.
This was not exorbitant, under the circumstances in
which it was given. The current rate of interest, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the best security, was 1 per cent. per month on running
account, while 2 to 3 per cent. on temporary loans per
month was common.</p>

<p>As a body of merchants, we found them honourable
and reliable in all their dealings, faithful to their contracts,
and large-minded. Their private residences, of
which we visited several, were on a vast scale, comprising
curiously laid-out gardens, with grottoes and lakes,
crossed by carved stone bridges, pathways neatly paved
with small stones of various colours forming designs of
birds, or fish, or flowers.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful was that of Pwankeiqua,
on the banks of the river, three or four miles west of the
Factories. The number of servants in these private
'palaces,' as they would be called elsewhere, was very
great, comprising, with those ordinarily in attendance,
doorkeepers, messengers, palankin bearers, and choice
cooks. We had occasional opportunities of judging of the
skill of the latter by an invitation to a 'chopstick' dinner,
signifying that no foreign element would be found in it.</p>

<p>We would be served with such delicacies as birds'-nest
soup,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with plover's eggs and Beche-de-Mar, curiously
prepared sharks' fins and roasted snails; these forming
but a very small proportion of the number of courses,
which ended with pastry of different sorts. The liquids
were wines prepared from rice, called 'Samshoo,' also
from green peas, from a fruit called Wang-pe, and others
whose names we never knew. The wines were served
in tiny silver or porcelain cups, each placed on handsomely
worked silver stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>These feasts were very enjoyable, even when their
novelty had worn off; the host, full of <i>bonhomie</i> and
politeness, never failing to escort us to the great outer
gate on leaving, and place us under the charge of his
coolies, who would there be waiting with large lanterns
bearing his name to escort us back to the Factories.</p>

<p>It is not true, as has been supposed, that on these
convivial occasions the guests were served with roast
or boiled 'puppy' as a <i>bonne bouche</i>, and I am sure
that the author of the following lines gave way to his
imagination after a 'chopstick' dinner with 'green pea'
wine when he wrote them, or to fortify a current joke:&mdash;</p>

<p>Numerous instances of munificence and generosity
can be recorded on the part of the Hong merchants. I
relate some of the <i>senior</i> one as illustrations. He would
accept the direct consignment of an American ship, if it
was commanded by an old friend. Such a one came to
Whampoa, commanded by Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, having on
board a cargo consisting in a great measure of quicksilver.
The price of this article was much depressed at
the time. It was landed at Houqua's Hong and stored,
he offering to take it at its market value. Several
months elapsed, when the close of the south-west
monsoon foretold 'business,' and the Factories began to
look out for return cargoes for their ships of new teas
daily arriving. Quicksilver still remained without
demand. At the price it bore, a considerable deficiency
would exist in the capacity of the vessel and the quantity
of teas which could be bought with the proceeds. At
the same time news had arrived of an improvement in
prices at New York which exhibited a large profit.
Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, therefore, judging it better to sell his
quicksilver and load with all the despatch he could with
as many teas as it would purchase, closed the sale, which
was, in commercial phraseology, 'puttee book' (duly
recorded). Tea purchases were then immediately made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in the course of which Houqua said to his consignor,
'Olo flen,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> you shall have a full cargo to return with; I
will furnish it, you can pay my next voyage&mdash;you no
trub' (give yourself no anxiety). Everything being
thus definitely arranged, the vessel commenced loading,
and was half full, when Houqua came to Captain C&mdash;&mdash;
and informed him that a sudden demand had arisen for
'quick'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> on the part of northern merchants returning to
their provinces, that it had advanced materially in value,
and he had been credited with the parcel he brought out
<i>at the price of the day</i>; moreover, that he had cancelled
on his books the first purchase. This generous act on
the part of his consignee enabled Captain C&mdash;&mdash; to
leave with a full cargo, all paid for, and made a difference
in the outturn of his voyage of nearly 30,000 dollars.
This information I received some years after at Canton
from Captain C&mdash;&mdash; himself.</p>

<p>An American gentleman, who had resided many
years at Canton, and had possessed a considerable
fortune, met with serious losses. The hope of regaining
it induced him to continue operations, in which he was
materially assisted by Houqua. They had been, as was
usually said, in the words of the place, 'olo flen.' Time
passed, considerable sums were placed at the disposal
of Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, no reference being made to them by the
Hong merchant, until, at the end of a second or third
year, Houqua's and his accounts were compared, and the
balance in favour of Houqua was 72,000 dollars. For
this amount he took a promissory note and it was locked
up in his strong box. From knowing Chinese, I was
often behind the scenes on similar occasions, not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the holder had any doubt of irregularity on the part of
the signers, but simply to translate them into his
language for his own satisfaction. It may be stated here
that not a single Chinese then existed at Canton who
could read or write English. I found that these notes
bore simply the endorsement of sum and date with the
names of the drawers. Time still went on; Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;
had frequently expressed a desire to return to the
United States, but hoped that a 'good turn' would take
place in his affairs and enable him to cancel his note.
It was cancelled in a most unexpected manner!</p>

<p>One day, when on a visit to his Chinese friend, the
latter said, 'You have been so long away from your own
country, why do you not return?' To which Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;
replied that it was impossible&mdash;he could not cancel his
note, and this alone would prevent him. Houqua enquired
if the bond, only, kept him in Canton, and if he
had not some means wherewith to provide for a residence
at home? The answer was that no other debts existed,
and he was not without resources&mdash;but the note!!
Houqua summoned his purser, and ordered him to bring
the envelope containing promissory notes from the
treasury. Taking out that of Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, he said, 'You
and I are No. 1, "olo flen;" you belong honest man, only
no got chance.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He then tore the note up, and throwing
the fragments into the waste-paper basket, added,
'Just now hav settee counter, alla finishee; you go, you
please.' That is to say, 'Our accounts are now all settled,
you can leave when you like.'</p>

<p>When the English troops, under Sir Hugh Gough, on
May 21, 1841, had taken up a position on the heights north
of the city walls, and were prepared to attack, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
prevented doing so by a despatch from Captain Elliot, the
British Superintendent of Trade at Canton, then on board
the cutter 'Louisa,' lying off the Factories. He informed
Sir Hugh Gough that the city had consented to pay a
ransom of six millions of dollars, and directed him to
return to the ships in the river with the forces. This
was a judicious and humane arrangement, brought about
by Captain Elliot. Had the city been entered, the loss
of life would have been dreadful, to say nothing of the
destruction of houses and property. There would,
moreover, have been but little glory to gain, as it was
in a state of defence utterly inadequate to resist 2,200
English soldiers and sailors. The authorities of the city,
having concluded the arrangement for the ransom, began
at once to look about for money, and as usual <i>reminded</i>
the Hong merchants that something liberal was expected
of them.</p>

<p>They contributed 2,000,000 dollars, of which Pwankeiqua
gave 260,000, Houqua 1,100,000, and the others
640,000. A belief exists amongst the Chinese that
there is an invisible agency influencing man's career in
life, which they call 'Fung Shuy,' literally 'wind and
water.' A striking illustration of this belief was brought
out on this occasion. Houqua availed himself of the
<i>accident</i> of contributing, to express his gratitude to 'wind
and water' for notable incidents in his own life, and
in this way, mentally, he apportioned his donation.
For himself, in recognition of his 'prosperity,' 800,000
dollars; for his eldest son, 200,000 dollars for unswerving
filial piety; and 100,000 dollars for his youngest
son, who happened to be born when he himself had just
completed the full term of a 'cycle,' or sixty years. This
is considered a very happy coincidence, or No. 1 'Fung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Shuy.' For the total sum, Captain Elliot was handed
three promissory notes, drawn by Messrs. Russell &amp; Co.
at thirty days' date in favour of Houqua, by whom they
were endorsed to his order. Captain Elliot deposited
them for collection with Messrs. Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co.
and Dent &amp; Co. These firms had removed their offices
to Macao, as well as Messrs. Russell &amp; Co. The notes
were for 400,000, 400,000, and 300,000 dollars respectively.
At this time the last-named house held about
two and a half millions of dollars belonging to their constituent,
the endorser. As an instance of the just pride
Houqua took in his remarkable position and of his
commercial sagacity, a few days before the maturity of
the three notes a letter was received from him in
Chinese at Macao, which read thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Benevolent Elder Brother,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;The notes endorsed by
me to Elut,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> as you know, will soon be due. Offer to
pay them at once. You will see by calculating that if
the money is now accepted there will be a gain of over
nine hundred dollars by the discount. May all your
days be as one.'</p>

<p>Messrs. Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co. and Dent &amp; Co.
were immediately communicated with, the notes came in
for payment, and were cashed, less the discount, which
amounted to a little short of a thousand dollars! The
next time I saw Houqua in Canton he talked merrily
over the close of the transaction, and said, 'My all same,
"Ba-Blo."'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The old gentleman liked to compare himself
with that famous house with which, through Messrs.
Russell &amp; Co., he had had for years important business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Demands of money on the Co-Hong never ceased.
One instance was a requirement by the Viceroy that
they should pay off the indebtedness of three of their
own number to 'outside barbarians.' They were Hingtai,
Mouqua, and Kingqua. Houqua then paid
$1,000,000, Pwankeiqua $130,000, Pwan Hoyqua $70,000,
Samqua and Saoqua each $50,000, Footai $90,000. I
mention this circumstance as a feature of 'Old Canton;'
it being a measure taken to prevent complications with
Governments beyond the sea.</p>

<p>In contrast to the style of official language, private
letters from the Hong merchants left nothing to be
desired in civility. Here is one of many. In the year
1837, a few of us younger members of the community
established the 'Canton Regatta Club,' for boat-pulling
and sailing on the river, our chief amusements and
mode of taking the air. Nothing like a club had yet
existed. Presently the Hong merchants, in virtue of
their office as 'guardians' of our persons, as well as
our 'securities' in the eyes of the local government, on
hearing of the club organisation, being apprehensive of
accidents, they wrote this letter to one of the members:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Ham Tak, venerable old gentleman,&mdash;We beg respectfully
to inform you that we have heard of the intention
of our respected elder brother and other chin-te-le-mun<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
to race boats on the river. We know not
if this is true, but heretofore it has not been custom.
Should the authorities hear of this, we your younger
brothers would be reproved, not mildly, for permitting
you to act so indiscreetly. On the river, boats are
mysteriously abundant; everywhere they congregate
in vast numbers; like a stream they advance and retire
unceasingly. Thus the chances of contact are many, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
are accidents, even to the breaking of one another's boats,
to the injury of men's bodies, while more serious consequences
might ensue.</p>

<p>'We therefore beseech our worthy senior<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to make
known to the other chin-te-le-mun that they would
do well to refrain from contesting the speed of their
boats on the river, so that after troubles may not accumulate.
Then all will be well. Daily may your prosperity
increase, without difference.</p>

'<span class="smcap">Houqua, Mouqua, Pwankeiqua'<br />
and others</span>.<br />

<p>The amount of Houqua's fortune was frequently a
subject of debate; but on one occasion, in referring to it
in connection with his various investments in rice-fields,
dwellings, shops, and the banking establishments known
as shroffs, and including his American and English shipments,
he estimated it, in 1834, at twenty-six millions
of dollars. Assuming the purchasing power of money
at that time as being but twice greater than at the
present day, it would now represent a sum of $52,000,000.
He was a person of remarkably frugal habits (as regards
his style of living) from choice and from being of a
feeble frame of body. His generosity was boundless,
and in accounts he was singularly methodical and
precise, never multiplying them beyond what was
absolutely necessary. The two or three rooms which
he occupied during hours of business in his vast, well-regulated
Hong were furnished with simplicity itself.</p>

<p>He withdrew from general business with the
foreign community after the Honourable East India<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Company left Canton, and confined himself exclusively
to the house of Messrs. Russell &amp; Co. Through them
his foreign business was entirely managed. His yearly
shipments to London of those celebrated Chops of
Congo, grown on his family estates in the Woo-E
country, were well known and appreciated in the
English market. His transactions were on a very
important scale, and he entrusted them to his Canton
agents, through whom they were carried out, with the
well-merited confidence which they inspired. They
embraced England, the United States, and India. As
another illustration of his generous nature, I may refer to
an affair that took place nearly fifty years ago, in which
his orders were not complied with. We had shipped a
cargo, principally of raw silk belonging to himself, which
he had ordered from the silk country. It was sold at
a large profit. His instructions were that the proceeds
should be returned in East India Co. bills on Calcutta.
To our surprise and his disappointment, the result of the
sale was invested in a cargo of British goods. It was
as injudicious an arrangement (free trade then beginning)
to ship largely of English manufactures as his own
shipment was sagacious, for but little silk was exported
immediately after the opening of the trade. The result
showed a difference of many thousand dollars to his
detriment. On the deviation of orders becoming known
Houqua was at once informed that he should not suffer
for this breach of instructions, and for the loss we would
credit his account.</p>

<p>The old gentleman replied, 'My consider, my show
you to-mollo'&mdash;that is to say, he would think it over and
let us know his decision 'to-morrow.' The following
day he was at the office, and this was his decision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
which he emphasised by striking the floor with his cane&mdash;Write
to Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and tell him he must be more careful
in future, 'must take care.' He accepted the woollens,
and refused to accept any indemnity.</p>

<p>This last chief of the world-renowned 'Co-Hong,'
which ceased with the treaties after an existence of 130
years, died at Honam on September 4, 1843, aged
seventy-four, having been born in the same year with
Napoleon and Wellington, 1769.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next to the Hong merchants, other Chinese were
closely allied to the foreign community as 'Linguists'&mdash;so
called, as it used to be remarked, because they knew
nothing of any language but their own. They were
appointed by the Hoppo to act as interpreters, and
were duly licensed. Besides, this was in accordance with
the orders of the Pekin Government. As up to treaty
days, neither Consul nor Vice-Consul of a foreign nation
was 'officially' acknowledged, whenever either one of
these officers made a communication to the Hoppo, it
had to be done through the Hong merchants, to whom
the despatch was taken by a Linguist. The reply would
be addressed to these merchants, who were directed to
make known the answer to the 'Chief' of the nation,
that 'he might reverently inform himself of it and be
duly obedient' (a matter of form).</p>

<p>The principal Linguists were 'Old Tom,' 'Young
Tom,'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and 'Alantsae.' They were at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
numerous assistants employed in the ordinary business
of foreigners, such as attending upon Mandarins from
inside the city while examining merchandise being
landed or shipped off, and making up reports of the
duties for those officers to take to the Hoppo's office
for registration and subsequent collecting. Their
duties were by no means light. They were liable to be
summoned at any moment, night or day, in connection
with the multifarious matters in which their
services were required. They were always ready and
ever willing, and proved a wonderful convenience to the
community at large. Through them we applied for
permits when going on a trip to Macao, for the shipping
off of an entire cargo of teas or for landing one of
foreign goods. All details of whatever nature were
regulated and attended to by them. By law and 'old
regulations,' on an excursion on the river, to the
'flower gardens' a few miles off, or to the Great
Buddhist Temple at Honam, opposite the Factories,
a Linguist <i>should</i> personally attend. One was also at
our disposal for a visit to any other place to which the
'regulations' or 'old custom' permitted us to go. It
may be added at the same time that the 'regulations'
which required his personal presence on such occasions
were not strictly enforced, but they were never abolished.
The object of the Mandarins in enjoining upon the
Linguists that one of them should accompany foreigners
in their walks or boating excursions was from the best
of motives&mdash;that these should not lose their way or
become involved in collisions with the people arising
from ignorance of one another's language. It was the
duty of a Linguist to distribute amongst the Factories
any Government proclamations having reference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
their affairs, relating to vessels at Whampoa or the
'receiving ships' at Lintin. In regard to these last
the Linguist would 'translate it,' and point out that
the 'Man-ta-lee' said, 'if they did not immediately get
up their anchors and return to their own countries or
come to Whampoa, cruisers would be sent down to
drive them away, and no more patience manifested.'
Then would come the time-honoured question of 'You
savee?' or, 'Do you understand?' with the usual addition
of, 'This time the Mandarin is <i>really</i> in earnest.' The
precious document would then be deposited in the leg
of his stocking or in his boot (the customary receptacles),
and with 'My chin-chin you'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he would pass on to our
next-door neighbour.</p>

<p>During the shipping season, from October to March,
the Linguist of a ship in course of loading would be
summoned in the evening to a foreign counting-room
(if necessity required), and was frequently detained
until long after midnight while lists of teas to be shipped
off in the morning were being prepared. With these
lists he would then be obliged to go to perhaps several
Hongs, to see that the teas were in readiness and 'chop'
boats ordered to convey them to Whampoa. These
duties often involved a whole night's work, but no sign
of impatience or inattention was shown. When a vessel
was ready to be measured, the Linguist informed the
Hoppo, who then ordered an officer to Whampoa to
attend to this duty, and he was always attended by a
member of the Linguists' establishment called the
'mandarin' or 'official' Linguist. Should she be under
despatch, the Linguist furnished the agent with a memorandum
of the 'Measurement and Cumsha' charges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and at her final departure he brought to his office the
'grand chop,' or port clearance, which was only delivered
to him when he had furnished the Hoppo with
receipts or certificates of the import and export duties
having been paid, and satisfied him that all formalities
had been fulfilled. When a fire broke out near the
Factories they were immediately in attendance.</p>

<p>They were, as a body, 'our all in all.' The senior
Linguist, popularly known as 'Old Tom,' was a remarkable
man, both physically and mentally, one whose
calmness and self-possession never forsook him.
Whether threatened by the authorities or scolded by
foreigners, he never gave way to ill-humour. He was
wonderfully adroit in making everything smooth with
the mandarins and pleasant to the 'outside barbarians,'
even in questions the most irreconcilable.</p>

<p>Each vessel anchoring at Whampoa incurred a
Linguist fee of $250. For every chop-boat landing her
inward cargo, $15.22. Her outward cargo was taken to
her by the sellers of it, at their own risk and expense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most important Chinese within the Factory was
the <i>Compradore</i>. He was secured by a Hong merchant in
all that related to good conduct generally, honesty and
capability. All Chinese employed in any factory, whether
as his own 'pursers,' or in the capacity of servants, cooks,
or coolies, were the Compradore's 'own people;' they rendered
to him every 'allegiance,' and he 'secured' them as
regards good behaviour and honesty. This was another
feature that contributed to the admirable order and
safety which characterised life at Canton. The Compradore
also exercised a general surveillance over everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that related to the internal economy of the 'house,' as
well as over outside shopmen, mechanics, or tradespeople
employed by it. With the aid of his assistants, the
house and private accounts of the members were kept.
He was the purveyor for the table, and generally of the
personal wants of the 'Tai-pans' and pursers.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The treasury in which all the cash and valuables
were kept was under his charge, which was no light
matter, as with some houses the amount of cash was
extremely large, frequently over a million of dollars
and rarely under $150,000 to $200,000. During the
dull season, from April to October, the principal books
of accounts, all important correspondence and letter
books were also deposited in it. For many years after
1824, no such thing as a copying machine was known;
all copying was done by hand, and this exacted greater
care of business letters and papers, while as no Banks
existed in the old days, each house was its own banker.
The position of a Compradore was therefore one of
great responsibility, and I never knew of but one
betraying the trust reposed in him. Although his pay
was comparatively small, say $250 or $300 per annum
(the pay of our own was raised to $500), his perquisites,
from sources which had long been in existence, and had
become 'olo custom,' were very important. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
balance of the American trade was greatly in favour of
China, large quantities of Spanish and Mexican dollars
were yearly imported to make up the deficiency arising
from comparatively little other import cargo. Teas and
silks, and many minor articles coming under the general
head of 'Chow-chow,' were bought for cash. Thus every
ship from the United States brought largely of dollars
at times&mdash;as in the case of the 'Citizen,' $350,000, while in
1831 three vessels alone brought $1,100,000. Added to
these supplies, opium was invariably sold for cash, and
so were bills on London when they came into use; consequently
all this money passed primarily through the
hands of the Compradore. He derived a profit from
the process of <i>shroffing</i> which it underwent before being
deposited in the treasury; but after the goodness
of a parcel and its exact amount were ascertained, he
was liable for any bad money that might afterwards be
found amongst it. He paid the Shroff one-tenth of a dollar
per one thousand for examining it, while the fixed charge
by the Compradore was one-fifth. This formed an
important sum. Another one of his perquisites was five
copper cash (about a halfpenny) per dollar on all payments,
no matter to whom or on what account, of odd
sums less than one thousand dollars, which charge was
borne by the payee. He also derived benefit from loans
or advances made to 'Outside' Chinese merchants (and
from them) on contracts for silks and other merchandise
entered into with his employers, while on all Factory supplies
he received also a percentage. In the year 1823
occurred the first and only robbery by a Compradore
that came under my knowledge. He was in the service
of one of the two most important of the American houses,
then occupying No. 3 of the Suy Hong. He had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
use of a large sum belonging to the firm for his own speculations,
and it was accidentally discovered. Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;,
the then chief of the house, went directly to Houqua, the
Compradore's 'security,' and reported the loss. The
man himself was sent for, and, greatly to the indignation
of his patron, confessed to having used the money
for speculation, intending to replace it, but the unexpected
examination by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; had not allowed him
time to do so. Houqua sent the deficiency to the firm
the same evening. It was over $50,000.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have seen who and what were the Co-Hong, the
Outside Chinese merchants, the Linguists and Compradores,
and what their respective relations with foreigners
were. There now remains the <i>Shroff</i>, or money dealer,
whose services were indispensable, particularly in receipts.
They were manifest daily and hourly in the
broad arched passages passing through the Factories,
along which, as was constantly said, one could never
move without seeing heaps of silver being examined
and hearing its metallic ring as successive quantities
were poured in and out of copper scales. Scarcely a
day or even an hour passed without this glittering
accompaniment of old Canton life.</p>

<p>Pieces of silver as well as dollars were shroffed and
weighed before being deposited in the treasury. When
that was done, dollars had no longer a distinct existence,
for in commerce the Chinese treat silver and gold as
they do lead, iron, or copper. In this they show a
characteristic good sense, and are rewarded by it in the
facility with which all money transactions are carried on.
As the result of long experience, the imported dollar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was found to be worth 717/1000 taels in weight, and this
became the standard in all current book accounts. No
coined money exists in the Empire except copper cash,
with which every one is familiar. The use of it is confined
to the daily wants of the people, and it never enters
into transactions of importance, except when money-changers
replenish their stocks. The convenience of
such a circulating medium gives facility to every one,
no matter how humble his requirements, and was a
wise piece of legislation. The obverse of the coin bears
the name of the Emperor during whose reign it was
made, in Chinese characters, with two others which
mean 'circulating value.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Commerce, on the other
hand, stood in need of a larger representative of value,
and this was supplied by gold and silver bars or lumps
in portable sizes. Bar gold bears a small proportion
to bar silver in quantity, and is in oblong pieces usually
of ten taels in weight, and silver<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> in oval lumps called
'shoes' of various sizes and values. There is no
Government interference in the manufacture of these
bars and shoes for purposes of trade, no more than there
is of any other metal, while the guarantee of their
purity and value is simply the stamp of the Shroff or
money house by which they are issued.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of the non-existence of
gold or silver coin, imported dollars, from being continually
weighed and stamped when passing from hand
to hand, became 'chopped dollars' or 'cut money' in
Canton phraseology, the first from being stamped by
the Shroff on examining them, with any character which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he may select, and which is his guarantee of goodness.
In the shapeless form which they thus acquire, payments
are made by weight in taels, and its component
parts of mace, candareens, and cash.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This custom of
weighing metals has existed in China since 903 A.D.
If any money stamped by a Shroff on examination
proved bad, it was exchanged by him, but such cases
were extremely rare. A small pair of scales for money
transactions is generally carried by Chinese attached
to a waistbelt.</p>

<p>Shroffs examined all amounts brought to them by
any one, but went to the foreign Factories, to the Hong
merchants or other customers, when required. The
charge was small, and the amount of silver passing
yearly through their hands was enormous, as amongst
the Chinese all transactions were for money or its representative.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Shroffs were also 'changers'&mdash;providing when
required either Sycee, chopped dollars, or gold&mdash;as well
as bankers, making loans or receiving deposits. The
floors of their shops are covered with brown tiles, and
at the end of the year they can sell the privilege of
removing the floor for the chance of finding scraps of
silver which may have escaped through the interstices
of the tiles, the buyer of the privilege replacing the
floor at his own cost. I have heard of as much as fifty
taels (about $70) being paid to an important Shroff-shop
for such a transaction.</p>

<p>Several descriptions of dollars were imported from
1825, previous to which time the most numerous were
those of Carolus IV. of Spain. These kept the preference
above all others, and were currently known as 'Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Heads.' So accustomed were the Chinese to this dollar,
that when Carolus III. or Ferdinand VII. were offered,
they were taken with reluctance, while the 'Old Head'
commanded a premium, and it thus became an exception
to the general rule of 'breaking up.' For a long time
they had been taken by dealers in raw silk from the
middle provinces, in whole dollars, and finally so much
prejudice existed in their favour that they would take
no others except as cut money. This caused them
to advance in value to 10 and even 15 per cent.;
finally, during one season, we sold to the senior Hong
merchant $60,000 at a premium of 30 per cent.,½
receiving in exchange $78,000 in cut money. Ferdinand
VII.'s dollars became 'New Heads,' and next
came into favour, there being a diminishing supply
of the 'Old,' but they were never at more than 1 to 2
per cent. premium. Of other kinds there were Chilian,
Peruvian, Mexican, and United States, which were submitted
to the process of breaking up, and were never in
greater favour with the Chinese than cut money. They
were not 'old custom,' and they could not reconcile
themselves to the new effigies or legends which they
bore. Now and then, if wanted for a special occasion,
Mexican dollars could be passed at a small premium,
say 1 or 1½ per cent. It is very probable, as often supposed,
that the Shroffs had much to do with these
varied transactions; they were behind the scene and
perhaps they had, as many of the establishments belonged
to wealthy proprietors, who used them for purposes
of speculation in money.</p>

<p>Book accounts, as has been said, were kept in dollars
and cents by foreign houses, at the conventional rate
of 717/1000 of a tael per dollar. There was but one exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that of the English East India Company, which
adopted the more rational system of Chinese currency.
Payments for raw silk were made at 750/1000, for teas
720/1000, musk 750/1000, as well as for some kinds of opium.
As all Chinese produce went by weight, even raw and
manufactured silk, and as all computations were in
decimals, this system contributed to the ease with
which business was carried on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Pigeon-English</i> is the well-known name given to
that unique language through the medium of which
business was transacted and all intercourse exclusively
carried on between the 'Western Ocean' foreigners and
Canton Chinese. For years after my arrival but three
foreign residents were Chinese scholars&mdash;namely, Doctor
Morrison; the present Sir John Francis Davis, the last
Chief of the English East India Company's establishment;
and one American, myself&mdash;while 'Pigeon-English' had
grown up with the early days of foreign intercourse
with the port of Canton. It is not difficult to arrive at
the creation of this particular and strange language.
Foreigners came to Canton for a limited period, and
would not or could not apply themselves to the study of
so difficult a language as the Chinese, of which even a
sufficiency for commonplace purposes was not easy to
acquire, and if acquired would be useless anywhere else.
The local government also placed serious obstacles in
the way of learning it, to the length of beheading a
Chinese teacher for giving lessons. This is on the
authority of Dr. Morrison, who related to me an instance
that took place before I arrived, and he further informed
me that for years after his own arrival in 1807 he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
obliged, as a protection to his own teacher, to study at
night in a room with lights carefully screened.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the shrewd Chinaman succeeded
in supplying this absence of the knowledge of his own
language by cleverly making himself familiar with
<i>sounds</i> of foreign words, and conforming them to his own
monosyllabic mode of expression, at the same time using
simple Chinese words to express their meaning. He
thus created a language, as it may be called, deprived of
syntax, without the logic of speech, and reduced to its
most simple elements. It took firm root, became the
conventional medium of intercourse in respect to transactions
of enormous value and magnitude, and exists in
all its vigour and quaintness to this day.</p>

<p>It was undoubtedly an invention of the Chinese, and
long anterior to the appearance of the English at Canton
in its origin, as may be proved by the admixture of
Portuguese and Indian words still to be found in it, the
latter having probably been originally made known by
those primary visitors from the western world <i>viâ</i> India.
The English came more than a hundred years after;
words from their language were then gradually incorporated,
and increased with the disappearance of the
Portuguese, who confined themselves to their own growing
colony of Macao, until, finally, the former became
the principal traders, and thus this language became
known as Pigeon-English.</p>

<p>The word 'pigeon' is simply a corruption of 'business'
and with its companion means <i>business</i>-English. Of
Portuguese origin we have the most undoubted proof in
such words as <i>mandarin</i>, from mandar, to order; <i>compradore</i>,
from compra, to buy; <i>joss</i>, from Deös; <i>pa-te-le</i>,
from padre; <i>maskei</i>, from masqué, never mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<i>la-le-loon</i>, from ladraŏ, a thief; <i>grand</i>, from grande,
the chief, as, for instance, 'grand chop;' <i>junk</i>, from
the Portuguese sound of Chuĕng in the dialect of
the East Coast, where they first traded. Of Indian
words we have <i>bazaar</i>, a market; <i>Shroff</i>, money-dealer;
<i>chunam</i>, lime; <i>tiffin</i>, luncheon; <i>go-down</i>, from
kā-dang; <i>lac</i>, one hundred thousand; <i>cooly</i>, a labourer;
<i>chit</i>, a note or letter; <i>bungalow</i>, a cottage; <i>kāārle</i>, curry,
and others.</p>

<p>Some peculiarities of expression and application of
two words constantly used in Pigeon-English may be
mentioned. The language was by no means confined
to those of foreign, but it contained quite a vocabulary
of words of Chinese origin; it was, in fact, a very mixed
tongue. 'Chop,' for instance, is of perpetual occurrence.
It is the same as 'chŏ,' which signifies literally any
'document.' A shopkeeper's bill is a 'chop,' so is an
Imperial edict or a Mandarin's proclamation; a cargo-boat
is a chop-boat; it does duty also for a promissory
note, a receipt, a stamp or seal, a license for shipping
off or to land cargo, a mark for goods, or a permit.
'First quality' is expressed by 'first chop,' and an inferior
according to quality is No. 6, 8, or 10 'chop,'
the worst of all. When a cooly is sent on an errand
requiring haste, he is told to go 'chop-chop.' A 'first
chop' man speaks for itself, so does 'bad chop man.'</p>

<p>The variety of uses to which the compound word
'chow-chow' is put is almost endless, and in some cases
have a directly opposite meaning. For instance, a 'No. 1
chow-chow' thing signifies 'utterly worthless' but when
applied to a breakfast or dinner it means 'unexceptionally
good.' A 'chow-chow' cargo is an assorted cargo;
a general shop is a 'chow-chow' shop; provisions of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
kinds are classed under the general head of 'chow-chow;'
and, as may have been remarked in the list of the
Factories, one was called the 'Chow-chow' from its
being inhabited by divers Parsees, Moormen, or other
natives of India.</p>

<p>Although by the Chinese all foreigners were called
'Fan Kwaes,' or 'Foreign Devils,' still a distinction of
the drollest and most characteristic kind was made
between them. The English became 'Red-haired devils;'
the Parsees, from the custom of shaving their heads,
were 'White-head devils;' Moormen were simply 'molo
devils.' The Dutch became 'Ho-lan,' the French 'Fat-lan-sy,'
and the Americans 'Flowery-flag devils.' The
Swedes were 'Suy' and the Danes 'Yellow-flag devils.'
The Portuguese have never ceased to be 'Se-yang
kwae,' thus retaining the name first applied to them
on their arrival from the 'Western Ocean' (which
the words signify), while their descendants, natives of
Macao, are 'Omun kwae,' or 'Macao devils' from the
Chinese name of the town.</p>

<p>In the Canton book-shops near the Factories was
sold a small pamphlet, called 'Devils' Talk.' On the cover
was a drawing of a foreigner in the dress of the middle
of the last century&mdash;three-cornered hat, coat with
wide skirts, breeches, and long stockings, shoes with
buckles, lace sleeves, and in his hand a cane. I
have now one of these pamphlets before me. It commences
thus, 'Yun,' and under it is its 'barbarian'
definition, expressed in another Chinese word whose
<i>sound</i> is 'man.' After many examples of this kind
come words of two syllables&mdash;thus, 'kum-yat' with their
foreign meaning expressed by two other Chinese
characters pronounced 'to-teay' to-day&mdash;and so on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sentences, for which the construction of the language is
peculiarly adapted. This pamphlet, costing a penny or
two, was continually in the hands of servants, coolies,
and shopkeepers. The author was a Chinaman, whose
ingenuity should immortalise him. I have often wondered
who the man was who first reduced the 'outlandish
tongue' to a current language. Red candles should
be burnt on altars erected to his memory, and oblations
of tea poured out before his image, placed among the
wooden gods which in temples surround the shrine of a
deified man of letters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although during the south-west monsoon little
general business went on, transactions in Opium were
very active. It was the period when the new drug
arrived. Sales were made to brokers for cash (only)
against orders on the receiving ships. The orders would
be sent down by 'smug boats,'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which carried the Opium
to its several destinations. These boats, of a peculiar
build, were of great length and beam, the latter increasing
rather disproportionately abaft to give quarters to
brokers' agents who always went with them. The crews
numbered from sixty to seventy men, who, like all
Chinese boatmen, were singularly good sailors, intelligent
and very active. They plied the oars sitting on low
benches ranged on both sides of the deck, while additional
propelling power was provided in an enormous
mainsail and a foresail made of mats, bamboos, and
rattans. The armament was one large gun in the bows,
swivels, spears, and flint-lock muskets purchased from
foreign vessels. The 'smug boats' differed from Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cruisers in a less powerful armament, smaller crew,
and in the hull being bright varnished instead of painted
'black and red,' which are the colours of the latter.</p>

<p>On delivery of the opium, the receiving ships were
paid five dollars per chest,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> which was called 'cumsha'
(literally 'gold sand'), and two dollars for 'demurrage' if
the order was not presented within seven days. It was
always repacked, before being taken from the ship, in
mat bags, then marked with the owner's private sign
and the weight. At times as many as one hundred
chests, in bulk, would form a single cargo, whose market
value was from $150,000 to $200,000. The Canton
agent received five, afterwards reduced to three, per cent.
commission on sales. The time occupied in unpacking,
weighing, and repacking would occupy but a few hours.
The crews of the receiving ships were mostly Manila men
and some Lascars, while the shroffs, carpenters, and
boats' crews, cooks and servants were Chinese.</p>

<p>It is needless to say the opium trade was prohibited
by Imperial edicts as well as by proclamations of the
Canton authorities. The Chinese who dealt in 'foreign
mud'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> were threatened even with capital punishment,
but so perfect a system of bribery existed (with which
foreigners had nothing whatever to do) that the business
was carried on with ease and regularity. Temporary
interruptions occurred, as, for instance, on the installation
of newly-arrived magistrates. Then the question
of fees arose, but was soon settled unless the new-comer
was exorbitant in his demands, or, as a broker would
express it, 'too muchee foolo'&mdash;i.e. 'the man is crazy.'
In good time, however, all would be arranged satisfactorily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the brokers reappeared with beaming faces, and
'peace' and immunity reigned in the land.</p>

<p>Opium was never found for sale in Chinese shops
at Canton, nor were there any signs by which one
could judge where it was prepared for sale or for
smoking, it being used in no other form.</p>

<p>The Canton officials rarely made any reference to
the Lintin station; but sometimes, compelled by form
to do so, would issue a proclamation ordering vessels
'loitering at the outer anchorage' either to come into
port or sail away to their own countries, lest the 'dragons
of war' should be opened, and with their fiery discharges
annihilate all who opposed this, a 'special edict.'</p>

<p>Another branch of the opium trade was on the East
Coast, where vessels of moderate size, belonging to two
foreign houses at Canton, were stationed, say, near Amoy,
Chin-Chew, Cup-Chee, and the island of Namao. They
received supplies by brigs and schooners (all in this
business being known as 'coasters'), which, starting
from Lintin, touched at the anchorages above on going
up to deliver, and on their return collecting the proceeds
of sales. As an opportunity offered to get a practical
experience of this trade, which was carried on with
all the secrecy possible by the few engaged in it, I
availed myself of a suggestion from the house to take
a run up to Namao. We owned at the time a Boston
clipper schooner called the 'Rose,' which, in 1837, was
about leaving for that anchorage with a quantity of
opium sold at Canton for delivery there, and an additional
number of chests to try the market. The whole cargo
consisted of nearly 300 chests of the Canton value of
about $300,000. I joined the vessel at Capshuymun from
Macao with an English gentleman, my guest there, whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I invited to accompany me. The 'Rose' was soon ready
for sea; we made sail and started with a moderate south-west
monsoon. She was a foretopsail schooner of about
150 tons register, with her scuppers within two feet of
the water. The weather proved delightful, the wind
steady, and the sea smooth. We kept an eye upon the
barometer, it being the taiphoon season, and a sharp
look-out upon the fleet of 'fishing boats' which covered
the water, and the crews of which were peaceable fishermen
or cut-throat pirates according to circumstances.</p>

<p>We anchored on the inside of the island of Namao
on the third day, close by two English brigs, the
'Omega'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and 'Governor Findlay.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Inshore of us
were riding at anchor two men-of-war junks, with much
bunting displayed; one bore the flag of a 'Foo-Tseang'
or Commodore. Knowing the 'formalities' to be gone
through with the Mandarins, we expected a visit from
one, and until it was made no Chinese boat would come
alongside, nor would a junk, not even a bumboat. We
had no sooner furled sails and made everything shipshape,
when 'his Excellency' approached in his 'gig,'
a sort of <i>scow</i> as broad as she was long. Besides the
oarsmen, there were official and personal attendants,
in grass cloth with conical rattan hats and flowing
red silk cord surrounding them to the brim. He himself
sat majestically in an arm-chair smoking quietly.
A large embroidered silk umbrella was held over his
head, while servants with fans protected him from the
attacks of flies and mosquitoes. He was received at the
gangway by Captain Forster. His manner and bearing
were easy and dignified. When cheroots and a glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wine had been offered, the 'Commodore' enquired the
cause of our anchoring at Namao. The Shroff<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> gave him
to understand that the vessel, being on her way from
Singapore to Canton, had been compelled, through contrary
winds and currents, to run for Namao to replenish
her wood and water. Having listened attentively, the
great man said that 'any supplies might be obtained,
but when they were on board, not a moment must be
lost in sailing for Whampoa, as the Great Emperor did
not permit vessels from afar to visit any other port.' He
then gravely pulled from his boot a long red document
and handed it to his secretary, that we might be informed
of its purport.</p>

<p>It was as follows:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">An Imperial Edict.</span></div>

<p>As the port of Canton is the only one at which outside
barbarians are allowed to trade, on no account can they be
permitted to wander about to other places in the 'Middle
Kingdom.' The 'Son of Heaven,' however, whose compassion
is as boundless as the ocean, cannot deny to those who are in
distress from want of food, through adverse seas and currents,
the necessary means of continuing their voyage. When
supplied they must no longer loiter, but depart at once.
Respect this.</p>

<p>Taou-Kwang, 17th year, 6th moon, 4th sun.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This 'Imperial Edict' having been replaced in its
envelope and slipped inside of his boot (for service on
the chance of another foreign vessel 'in distress'), his
Excellency arose from his seat, which was a signal for all
his attendants to return to the boat except his secretary.
The two were then invited to the cabin to refresh, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
being done, we proceeded to business. The Mandarin
opened by the direct questions, 'How many chests have
you on board? Are they all for Namao? Do you go
further up the coast?' intimating at the same time that
<i>there</i> the officers were uncommonly strict, and were
obliged to carry out the will of the 'Emperor of the
Universe,' &amp;c.; but our answers were equally as clear and
prompt, that the vessel was not going north of Namao,
that her cargo consisted of about 200 chests. Then came
the question of 'Cumsha,' and that was settled on the
good old Chinese principle of 'all same custom.' Everything
being thus comfortably arranged, wine drunk and
cheroots smoked, his Excellency said, 'Kaou-tsze' ('I
announce my departure').<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We escorted him to the side,
over which he clambered with the aid of his secretary;
we saw him safely deposited under his brilliant silken
canopy, and in a short time rejoin his junk.</p>

<p>Chinese buyers came on board freely the moment
they saw the 'official' visit had been made. A day or
two after, several merchant junks stood out from the
mainland for the anchorage. As they approached we
distinguished a private signal at their mastheads, a
copy of which had been furnished to us before leaving
Capshuymun. We hoisted ours, the junks anchored
close to us, and in a surprisingly short time received
from the 'Rose' in their own boats the opium, which
had been sold at Canton, and there paid for, deliverable
at this anchorage. It was a good illustration of
the entire confidence existing between the foreign
seller in his Factory at Canton and the Chinese buyers,
and of a transaction for a breach of any of the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of which there existed no legal redress on one
side or the other. This parcel, whose value was
$150,000, had been already packed in bags, marked
and numbered, at Capshuymun. The Chinaman who
held the order of the Canton house for its delivery, on
coming on board unfolded it from a cotton handkerchief,
smoked a pipe or two and drank a cup of tea with
the Shroff while it was going over the side, then took
leave of us with the usual 'Good wind and good water,'
or, 'May your voyage be prosperous!' The junks had
anchored, mainsail to the mast, and as the last bag was
received on board the anchors were at the bow and they
standing to the northward.</p>

<p>Various attempts had been made to establish
'floating' depôts further north, for which purpose even
the coast of Corea had been visited, as well as the port
of Ke-Lung on the north end of the island of Formosa.
The clipper 'Sylph,' Captain Wallace, sailed up to the
Gulf of Leaou-Tung, having on board the celebrated
Prussian missionary Gutzlaff, who, for the privilege of
distributing the Scriptures and tracts, acted as interpreter
for the sale of opium. The Rev. M. Gutzlaff was an
'old coaster,' his first appearance in China being as passenger
from Singapore in a Chinese junk. As he had
also studied at Malacca, there was a fellow-feeling between
us. The first foreign opium vessel stationed on the East
Coast was the 'Colonel Young'<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> in 1831, her tender,
running between the station and Lintin, being the 'Fairy.'
M. Gutzlaff was for some time on board the former,
and, from his knowledge of the Chinese coast dialects,
could make himself very useful. He resembled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Chinese very much, while <i>they</i> declared him to be a
'son of Han in disguise'! The accounts of his travels
along the coast and in the interior which he gave me
on his return were very curious and interesting. He
would leave the brig and be absent many days together.
On one occasion he nearly reached the frontier of the
Canton province; on another he penetrated to the Bohea
tea-country, in the province of Fŭh-Keen. He described
the people as hospitable and kind. Sedan-chairs of a
rustic sort were furnished to him, with food without
stint, and he never failed to find quarters for repose and
refreshment in a temple. His object in travelling, besides
the acquisition of knowledge, was the distribution of
tracts. On visiting a town or village he would distribute
translations of 'The Word of Life' and administer 'Lee's
Antibilious.' Landing one day in the ship's boat, she
was capsized, and he found himself rolling about in the
surf with 'The poor man's friend,' a box full of 'Saints'
Rest,' to which he clung, and packages of 'Cockle's pills,'
while in momentary alarm that he and the boat's crew
(four Caffres) would be picked up by shovel-nosed sharks.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight I decided to return to
Capshuymun and Canton. My friend Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; was
agreeable, but the question was, how and when? The
'Rose' had still a considerable quantity of opium to dispose
of, and would not probably be ready for a month.
In this dilemma two days went by, when the schooner
'Harriet'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> came in from the northern stations. She was
a small fore and aft craft of nominally 100 tons, built at
Macao by Hamilton, an American ship carpenter, and
was commanded by a friend, Captain Hall, who consented
to take us back to Capshuymun. After she had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
treasure from the three Namao vessels, her entire freight
consisted of $430,000 in value of gold bars and Sycee-silver.
We went on board with our traps and servants, and were
soon under way. The cabin being, of course, of preposterously
small dimensions, and overrun with ants,
cockroaches, and centipedes, with which we should have
interfered, we made ourselves comfortable on deck&mdash;dining,
smoking, and joking <i>al fresco</i>. We anchored at
Kow-Lung just in time to escape an unusually heavy
taiphoon. We rode it out there; then sailed to Capshuymun,
and from thence direct to Canton by fast boat.</p>

<p>The 'Rose' subsequently foundered in a taiphoon,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
on July 21, 1841, only one of her crew being saved, a
Portuguese Sea-cunnie,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> who was for three days on a
plank. He was picked up by my old friend and shipmate,
Captain Fraser, in the 'Good Success,' thirty miles
from the Grand Ladrone.</p>

<p>This tedious review of the opium traffic, as existing
during the first fifteen years of my residence at Canton,
will give the reader a correct idea of the mode in which it
was carried on. The confiscation of 20,052 chests by
the Imperial Commissioner Lin, in 1839, checked the
local trade for a time, but did not do away with it. Up
to this period it had indeed been an easy and agreeable
business for the foreign <i>exile</i> who shared in it at Canton.
His sales were pleasantness and his remittances were
peace. Transactions seemed to partake of the nature of
the drug; they imparted a soothing frame of mind with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
three per cent. commission on sales, one per cent. on
returns, and no bad debts! To the agent each chest
was worth 20<i>l.</i> sterling, one year with another.</p>

<p>Consequent upon the seizure of the English-owned
opium, the city of Canton, lying at the mercy of Sir
Hugh Gough, was ransomed, as has been said, for
$6,000,000, and this sum was afterwards appropriated by
the British Government to indemnify its owners, who
had delivered it up, either directly, or indirectly through
their Canton agents, in obedience to the command of
Captain Elliot, 'for surrender to the Imperial Commissioner
on behalf of Her Majesty's Government.'</p>

<p>The amount of the ransom was much below the
ordinary market value, even of its cost; on the other
hand, no one could foresee to what a low price it <i>might</i>
fall, through the measures which were being taken by
the Pekin authorities to 'put an end for ever' to 'opium
smoking' in their dominions, and the whole arrangement
was, under the circumstances, a very reasonable one.</p>

<p>The largest quantity surrendered by any one house
was 7,000 chests; we came, I think, third on the list,
with 1,500 chests; the remainder was principally in the
hands of English, Parsee, and other native of India firms.
The appointment and approaching arrival of the Imperial
Envoy became known at Canton in the latter months
of 1838. The local Mandarins therefore began a
system of harshness towards dealers in order to appear
vigilant and active in the carrying out of old decrees.
This led to much cruel punishment, to the execution of
one man in the Square in front of the Factories, in
December 1838 (by way of casting obloquy upon the
foreigners), and an attempt to strangle another one there
in February 1839. This latter caused an unprecedented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
riot, led to an attack upon all foreigners who happened
to be out of their residences, several of them being
injured, and to the Factories being besieged by many
thousands of vagabonds, who kept up an incessant
attack on windows and gates with stones and brickbats.</p>

<p>They tore down and used as 'battering rams' the
heavy posts of which the small enclosures in front of each
Factory were constructed, yelling and shrieking like
so many wild animals. We were rather anxious that
some should force their way in, as we had distributed
broken bottles in great quantities up and down the
main entrance to our own Factory, No. 2 Suy-Hong, our
enemy being a barefooted crowd, while against the other
great casks of coal had been rolled; we were not gratified
by seeing the efficacy of the first protection. The
mandarins had brought an 'opium dealer' to the Square
about noon, in order to strangle<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> him there. The Cross
was already driven in the ground, and in a few minutes
it would have been all over, when an unusual hubbub of
something extraordinary being about to take place
attracted the attention of some foreigners who were on
the Square at the time. Instantly the news flew from
Factory to Factory, when all we could muster, perhaps
seventy to eighty, rushed out to stop the proceeding.
I acted as spokesman on behalf of all present, and protested
against the Square being turned into an execution
ground. The Mandarin in charge said that the orders
he had received must be carried out, that the Square
was a portion of His Celestial Majesty's Empire. He
was told that might be, but it was leased to us as a recreation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ground, and that we <i>would not permit</i> its
desecration by a public execution! This was a bold
thing to say. During this short interval the scene was a
most extraordinary one. There was the cross, and close
to it the victim with a chain about his neck, held by two
gaolers, all looking on with a quiet curiosity. The servants
of the mandarin were supplying him with constantly
renewed pipes; his attendants, a few soldiers, and his
chair-bearers, seemed more amused than anything else.
There is no telling what might not have taken place
had it not been for a boat's crew who happened to come
from Whampoa that morning. They belonged to the old
East India Company's ship 'Orwell,' Captain 'Tommy'
Larkins, formerly of that Company's service, and a well-known
and general favourite in the community. These
sailors had been wandering about the Square, but
gradually approached the spot and looked on. Seeing
the drift things were taking, suddenly they seized the
cross, smashed it in pieces, and began to lay them over
the heads and shoulders of the executioners and any
Chinamen within reach. The gaolers dragged the prisoner
away. Jack tore down a tent that had been pitched for
the mandarin, capsized the chairs, the table, with the teapot
and cups, and would next have attacked the mandarin
himself had we not interfered to protect him. We
were much relieved when his Excellency and his aids
were carried away and no harm done to them, and we
found ourselves in possession of the ground. Then cried
out one of the sailors to another, 'I say, Bill, we don't
get such a lark as this every day!'</p>

<p>The siege of the Factories by the mob was continued
throughout the afternoon, the guards at the corner of the
American Factory were obliged to retreat after ineffectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
efforts to clear the ground of our assailants, and things
looked very serious. In the 'Imperial' Factory, Captain
St. Croix, of the 'Alexander Baring,' had collected all the
inmates, armed with such weapons as they had amongst
them, revolvers and fowling-pieces, and proposed a rush
out, but happily no demonstration was made. There were
without doubt eight or ten thousand of the vilest of the
population seemingly bent on the destruction of the
'foreign devils.' Towards five o'clock some one suggested
that it might be worth while to get notice of our situation
to Houqua. It looked as if the Mandarins had left us at
the mercy of the mob, while the streets were completely
blocked, and no Chinaman probably thought of going
on such a mission. Mr. G. Nye (an American gentleman)
and myself undertook to go and see him. Getting on
the roof of No. 4 'Suy-Hong' we managed to cross
to that of a shop in Hong Lane, through which we
descended, and after some exertion reached the street
in the rear of the Factories, called the 'Thirteen Factory
Street,' which led to Houqua's Hong. We found the
old gentleman in some trepidation from the news that
had been already brought to him, but he seemed quite
ignorant of the Square and the Factories being at the
mercy of the crowd. He at once despatched a messenger
to the 'Kwang-Chow-Foo,' the chief magistrate of
the city, and we returned the way we had come. About
half-past six o'clock, to our great relief we heard the
approaching sound of the gong, denoting the coming
of the officers, and witnessed from our verandah the
immediate dispersion with whips of the rabble. No
one was spared, the sight of the numerous soldiers in
attendance on the Mandarins caused a rush towards
every outlet from the Square, and even to the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
where several were drowned, not a boatman offering them
the least assistance. Wide open flew the Factory gates,
and in an instant their imprisoned occupants appeared
with looks of relief indescribable. The Mandarins passed
the night on the ground, chairs were procured for them,
official lanterns were lighted, and, conscious of the
entire safety which we now enjoyed, and without being
disturbed by the hourly beating on gongs of the different
watches of the night, we all turned in. The next
day everything reassumed its normal state of comfort
and safety. The 'victim' had been strangled at the
public execution ground, to which he was taken from
the Square. Approaching the Mandarins in the morning
to thank them for their timely assistance (rather a
'cool' thing to do, as some one remarked, seeing we
had taken the law in our own hands and had driven
away the officer of justice the day before!), they received
us very courteously, and assured us we had
'nothing to fear!'</p>

<p>This was the most serious of many provocations
inflicted by foreigners upon the authorities. We treated
their 'chops,' their prohibitions, warnings, and threats,
as a rule, very cavalierly. We often spoke of their forbearance
and wondered at the aid and protection they extended
to us; in fact, they considered us more as unruly
children, people who had never had an opportunity of
becoming acquainted with 'Taou-Le,' or 'reason.'</p>

<p>When the Imperial Government took the unlooked-for
measure of seizing the English-owned opium and
punishing the native dealers, the day seemed to have
arrived when the trade in it would really cease. The
Canton houses had been forcibly deprived of their stocks;
the supply on the East Coast, under the control of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
few of them, was diminishing, with no fresh supplies to
look forward to. Quantities which were on their way
from India were being landed at Singapore or sent over
to Manila, while further shipments from the former
country were entirely suspended. On all sides a complete
darkness existed as to what would be the result. Holders
were offering to sell at Singapore for next to nothing;
the article was in reality a drug indeed. Even as low
as $150 to $200 per chest became its nominal value
in the Straits. This was the condition of the 'opium
question' which quickly followed the confiscation.
The foreign community, with the exception of the
Americans, had all left Canton, and at first took up
their quarters on board of ships at 'Kow-Lung;' but
having been bombarded out of that anchorage by the
mandarins, 'Toon-Koo,' at the mouth of the 'Capshuymun,'
became the general rendezvous. One day a
clipper schooner got under way and stood seaward,
and some time elapsed before she was heard from
again. She had taken on board a few chests of opium
that had arrived since the seizure. At the moment of
sailing a letter was handed to the captain, directing him
to open one of two others enclosed, after he should
have got clear of the land. On doing so he found that
he was ordered to make the best of his way to Singapore,
to land the opium he had on board, and deliver
the unopened letter to his consignee there, by whose
instructions he would be subsequently governed. The
schooner consequently proceeded on her voyage, the
captain not having the slightest intimation of the object
of it. Simply, he was directed to reply to any enquiries
on arrival that he had brought down opium. The
twenty chests were landed at a moment of the day when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the Bund was crowded with Moormen, Jews, Parsees,
and Chinese, all opium holders or brokers. No letters had
of course been received by them, but at the unprecedented
sight of twenty chests being landed they concluded
that now indeed 'God was great and Mohammed
was his prophet,' and that China had at last resolved to
permit no more poisonous drug to be landed on its
shores. Before twenty-four hours had passed, so
adroitly had the agent made his plans, that, aided by
clever brokers, he secured nearly 700 chests, quietly,
here a little and there a little, at prices 'dirt cheap.'
Opium had been unsalable at Singapore, many of the
holders were unable to hold, and some were under orders
to sell for whatever they could get, and 'have done with
it;' the average of the purchase in question was $250
per chest. The twenty chests were re-shipped to the
schooner, the newly purchased were taken on board, and
after a very short detention she sailed, whither no one
knew. She was bounding up the China Sea. Her destination
was the East Coast, and there her cargo was
readily disposed of at an average of $2,500 per chest.</p>

<p>Inside of the city of Canton, as we heard from
Chinese, the price rose to $3,000, while the sale of it
or the smoking of it was almost a matter of life and
death&mdash;the latter was the penalty threatened and even
carried out against those who were known to indulge
in it. The Imperial Commissioner was on the spot; he
was inexorable, consternation prevailed throughout the
Chinese community, but we heard from good authority
that the number of the beheaded was not large.</p>

<p>While the opium trade was going on, discussions
often occurred as to the morality of it, as well as to the
effect of smoking on the Chinese. None of the Hong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
merchants ever had anything to do with it, and several
of the foreign houses refrained from dealing in it on
conscientious grounds. As to its influence on the inhabitants
of the city and suburbs at large, they were a
healthy, active, hard-working, and industrious people,
withal cheerful and frugal. They were intelligent in
business, skilful in manufactures and handicrafts. These
traits are inconsistent with habitual smoking, while the
costliness of the prepared drug was such as to render
a dilution of it (to bring it within the means of
the masses) utterly harmless. Amongst the wealthier
classes, no doubt, it was more or less common, this we
knew; but I myself, and I think I may safely say the
entire foreign community, rarely, if ever, saw any one
physically or mentally injured by it. No evidences of
a general abuse, rarely of the use of the pipe, were
apparent. I remember one man having been brought
to a missionary hospital to be treated for excessive
smoking of opium, but he was looked upon as a Lion
and much was made of him. In fact, smoking was a
habit, as the use of wine was with us, in moderation.
As compared with the use of spirituous liquors in the
United States and in England, and the evil consequences
of it, that of opium was infinitesimal. This is
my personal experience during a residence at Canton,
Macao, and Hong Kong of forty years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For many years after the first foreign merchants
came to Canton, they were not permitted to remain after
their vessels were despatched, but were obliged to leave
in them. In the case of the great Companies such as
the English East India and the Dutch, it gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
became a great inconvenience. These, therefore, retired
to Macao, where in time residences were specially built
for their accommodation. (The old Dutch factory there,
which had stood for over a century, was destroyed by a
taiphoon in 1875.) The removal from Canton to Macao
took place at the close of the north-east monsoon,
simultaneously with the commencement of the dead
season, when the market would have been cleared of teas
and few or no vessels at Whampoa. Macao possesses
a delightful climate, completely within the sea breezes,
and is beautifully situated; it moreover offers in its
entirety perhaps a unique specimen of Western colonies
in the Eastern world as they existed 250 years ago&mdash;in
its forts, churches, and walls, its convent, senate-house,
and the extensive, solidly built, private residences.</p>

<p>The Bay of Macao, looking eastward, is strikingly
like that of Naples. The fine houses which border it
are protected by a broad esplanade,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> supported by a sea-wall
with a low parapet. The view from it is very fine
across the outer harbour in a north-east direction to the
islands of Lantoa and Lintin; to the north lie the 'Nine
Islands,' and south-westerly is the anchorage called
'Taypa,' between the islands of Montanha to the west
and Cabreta to the east. This anchorage is about three
miles from Macao, and (as well as the two islands) is
under the sovereignty of the Portuguese. West of
Macao is the inner harbour, which separates it from the
island called the 'Lappa.' On it in the early days the
Portuguese built villas and laid out gardens, but they
were subsequently abandoned from an inability to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
them effectually from Chinese marauders and pirates,
and in 1825 a few vestiges of them only remained.</p>

<p>The departure from Canton of the Factory was
annually quite a circumstance. From fifteen to twenty
'chop-boats' were drawn up at the Company's landing,
of which some were converted into sleeping apartments,
for which their high decks and capacious holds, which were
floored off, afforded ample space. On either side were
large windows, with curtains and movable shutters, for protection
against rain. Others were appropriated to several
milch cows and their keepers, for supplies for the journey,
as well as books and papers of value. The members
of the Factory, rarely fewer than twenty to twenty-five,
occupied the others with their personal servants; and,
what with Compradore's men, cooks, and coolies, the
entire number was not less than 250 to 300 persons,
including the boats' crews. On the arrival of the Linguist
with the Government permit, the fleet set sail amidst
the beating of gongs, burning fire-crackers and small
squares of red paper, as a propitiation to the gods presiding
over rivers and streams. The boats always took
the Macao passage, as it was called, which is a broad
stream branching off from the Pearl River, about a half-mile
westward of the factories and running due south;
consequently they passed the Factories, affording altogether
a fine sight. The distance to Macao, taking
the curves of the river, is about 120 miles, and the
journey averages three or four days. As the return
to Canton formed also an event in local life, being at
Macao when the Company left in October 1831, I was
glad to have the opportunity of availing myself of an
invitation from Mr. Majoribanks, the then 'Chief,' to go up
with them. A chop-boat was placed at the disposal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
young John Robert Morrison and myself, and the following
particulars of the trip to the provincial city are from
a letter written by me at the time to a relation in the
United States:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center">On board the 'Golden Galley,' Macao to Canton: October 4, 1831.</div>

<p>It was the intention of the Factory to embark on the 1st,
but the departure was postponed to the 2nd. A circular was
then sent to the members, requesting them to be on board
their respective boats by half-past ten the next morning, at
which time they were to get under way. Accordingly, my
chum and I joined our chop-boat, anchored in the inner
harbour with thirteen others, which composed the fleet. Presently
a signal was made by the boat of Mr. Davis, Chief of
the Select Committee, hoisting its mainsail, and in a few
minutes we were sailing in line through the harbour. We
numbered, including invited guests, thirty-eight foreigners.
Three of the boats (which in foreign measurement would be
of, say, 120 tons) were full of Factory coolies, cows, and provisions,
the latter in addition to each one having a supply on
board sufficient for three days. Our chop is large and comfortable;
we have a cabin, by means of partitions, 14 feet by
10 and 7 feet high, and forward of it is another for our servants,
the cook, and stores. Two couches, one on either side,
serve for beds, added to which are tables, toilette arrangements,
and everything complete, with cleanliness the most perfect.
We breakfast and dine as regularly and in as good style as on
shore. Some boats have four gentlemen and others five, as
arranged among themselves. They are chartered by the
Factory twice a year, and each one receives one hundred
Spanish dollars for the trip up or down. Provisions and furniture&mdash;in
fact, all things needful&mdash;are also supplied by the
Company. We have not with us all the members, some remaining
awhile longer at Macao; but amongst those now on
their way to Canton are Dr. Colledge and Padre Vachell, as
well as that other important personage, the Steward Canning!
The Company's Compradore also accompanies the fleet, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>three or four fast boats under his control for carrying messages,
making visits, or distributing fresh milk. So you see everything
is as cosy as possible. The crews, numbering about fifteen
men to each boat, manage them with surprising dexterity.
These Chinese boat people are perhaps unequalled by any
others in the world. They are not only active and intelligent,
but good-natured and obliging, and seem anxious to get on as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Now that I have given you a sketch of our accommodation,
I will go on with our passage from the inner harbour. While
passing through it, volleys of fire-crackers were let off, and
gongs were beaten by way of 'chin-chining Joss' for a safe
and pleasant passage. A little later dinner was served, and a
No. 1 dinner it was. Crab soup to begin with, an ample dessert,
Hodgson's pale ale, superb La Rose and sherry, with
custard-apples, plantains, and other fruits. We turned in at
eleven, but slept little, as the wind was dead ahead after entering
the 'Broadway,' so I was up early and on deck. The
fleet was hard at it, tack and tack to windward. We found
ourselves in the middle of it, those to windward about three
miles off, and those to leeward about the same distance. At
eight o'clock we passed the Mo-tow, or 'Knife-grinding,' Fort,
which was once a stronghold of the celebrated pirate Apotsae,
who pillaged all the country round about. Near to it were
lying two of His Celestial Majesty's men-of-war junks. The
day's supply of fresh milk was brought on board, and at eight
breakfast, which was attended with difficulty, from the heeling
over of the boat. We entered the 'Heang-Shan'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> River, but at
11.30 were all obliged to anchor within five miles of the city,
as it had begun to blow a violent gale, the rain coming down
in torrents. On the morning of the 5th, cloudy and rainy, but
the wind abating somewhat and the tide being favourable, we
hove up, and at 8.30 passed Heang-Shan. We expected to
anchor to receive the customary visit of the mandarin, but he
may not have felt inclined to turn out in such weather. It
happened that the Compradore, who had gone up in a fast boat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>the evening before, procured from him his seal to the Company's
'chop,' which allowed us to go on without anchoring;
but through all this fuss and his absence we lost the milk for
our after-dinner tea! On the morning of the 6th the Compradore
was again alongside, and made it 'all right' with <i>us</i> by
threatening to come again with mutton for dinner; and, considering
what we have 'undergone' since leaving Macao, it
will be very acceptable.</p>

<p>The scenery on both sides of the river is celebrated for its
beauty, and we enjoyed it much. The banks are lined with
orange and lemon trees, peaches and lychee. On the summit
of a high hill stands a seven-story pagoda. If you ask a
Chinaman its object or use, he replies that it is 'Joss pigeon,'
and you are as wise as you were before. In reality, the Chinese
believe that these buildings bring prosperity on the region
and ward off evil influences. The river is crowded with boats
crossing from one bank to the other, filled with all sorts of
country produce or passengers, who stare their very eyes out
in looking at us. Further on we pass another fort, with a
curious name, the 'Old Duck,' and on the riverside opposite
is another called 'Greatly Excellent.' In the afternoon a fine
strong breeze sprang up, and we made rapid progress, passing
still another fortification, called the 'Mouth of the Great Gate.'
We were compelled to dine on a superb roasted capon, with
<i>et ceteras</i> as usual. We just touched at 'Che-nae' for the
official formality, and soon after the Western Fort was passed,
when we saw the innumerable lights and lanterns of the provincial
city; and at 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> glad enough we were to find ourselves
once more in 'Old Canton.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Dutch East India Company followed the same
programme to and from Macao. The members of this
Company were never so numerous as that of the English.
There were usually two gentlemen to manage all affairs,
with three or four 'writers.'</p>

<p>Under various pretexts, other foreign merchants
managed to remain at Canton the year out. One was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that their import cargo not having been sold, consequently
the tea and other merchandise which they had
shipped was unpaid for. This, if not considered reasonable,
at all events had the effect of causing the authorities
to overlook their presence, and gradually that
article of the 'old regulations' became a dead letter.</p>

<p>Having seen the manner in which the great Companies
went between Canton and Macao, it will be curious
to follow the 'private' individual and the formalities that
had to be gone through (which, however, applied to
those Companies as well). A linguist was sent for, to
whom was given the name and nationality of the person
requiring a permit for Macao, and he would take them
to the Hong merchants. Three or four of these would
then petition the Hoppo that the request might be
granted. Amongst these merchants must be included
the one who 'secured' the foreigner in question. On
the third day after, the linguist would reappear at the
Factory and give notice that the luggage, &amp;c. must be
examined by an officer from the Hoppo's office, which
having been done, the permit would be given to the
head boatman, and on the fourth day the boat could
proceed on her journey. It must not be supposed that
these old 'government regulations' were never infringed,
for in my own case, in 1830, being ill, I asked Houqua
to use his influence that I might leave at once, and in
twenty-four hours my papers were ready and I was off.
The boats in which foreigners travelled to and from
Macao (except occasionally if a large party, when they
took chop-boats) acquired the name of 'inside fast
boats.' They were large and commodious, with cabins
in which one could stand up, broad raised seats on two
sides, covered with clean matting, on which one slept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
They were furnished with green Venetian blinds. In the
centre of the cabin stood the dining-table, and over it a
lamp was suspended. The accommodation was ample for
four persons. Abaft the main cabin was a smaller one,
for the servants and cook; then came the stern-sheets,
occupied by the helmsman and two or three men to work
the main-sheet. On one quarter was the kitchen; forward
of the principal cabin was a flush deck to the bows;
there stood the foremast, and ten to twelve oars could
be used. The crew consisted of twelve or fifteen men,
always alert, hard-working, and good-natured. The trip
down the river or up was particularly enjoyable; the
respite from office duties imparted a new sensation; and, if
made in the south-west monsoon, nothing so exhilarating
after the close hot Factories as this breeze fresh from
the sea. The entire cost of the trip was for the boat
eighty dollars, and the invariable 'cumsha,'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> ten or fifteen
more, according to one's humour after a quick or tedious
passage.</p>

the particular occasion now referred to a fifth was
added.</p>

<p>No. 1. The petition from the Hong merchants
applying for the pass to Macao, which read thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas it is our duty to petition for permits for Macao,
it now appears that the barbarian merchant, H&mdash;&mdash;, having
clearly set forth that on a former year he came to Canton to
trade, now wishes to visit Macao. Not daring to resort to
illegal ways, he has begged us to entreat the favour of an
official passport being granted to him, that he may submit it
for inspection at the several stations on the route. Such being
the barbarian's wishes, we petition that he may be officially
permitted to proceed.</p></blockquote>

<p>As my departure for Macao on this occasion took
place a month or two after the surrender of the opium,
unusual strictness was observed for fear that some of the
nine foreign merchants selected by the 'Kinchae'<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as
hostages might escape. The following extra document
was therefore issued:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 5.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An extra permit granted by the officer appointed by the
Imperial Commissioner, occasioned by the opium affair, and
stationed in front of the foreign Factories, to take cognisance of
all foreigners arriving at and leaving Canton. Le, waiting preferment,
specially appointed, now reports to the Kwang-Chow-Heĕ.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>

owned by Chang, having on board the barbarian H&mdash;&mdash;, leaves
this 16th sun of the 4th moon for Macao, no delay must take
place. Moreover, as neither of 'the nine' forbidden to leave
are on board, custom-houses will permit her to pass.</p>

<p>The House Compradores were always glad to avail
themselves of such an opportunity to send to Macao a lot
of 'Chow-chow' cargo on their own account, a privilege we
never refused. This accounts for the sentence in No. 4&mdash;'proceeding
to Macao with fine tea for sale.' Whence came
the 200 catties (266 pounds) of lead was a mystery to me,
but the 270 catties of 'iron ware' were iron chests, and
270 catties of foreign white paper certain office books
of accounts and stationery, removed from the Canton
offices in consequence of the unsettled state of affairs,
with a quantity of house stores, &amp;c. The details of
everything is peculiarly a Chinese idea, and as similar
documents are now no longer issued, and the <i>inside</i>
passage to Macao never taken under former circumstances,
they are curious in their way. The <i>outside</i>
passage, by the way of the Bogue and in splendid
steamers, is now the order of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The word <i>tea</i> is of Chinese origin, being a corruption
of <i>tay</i> in the Fuh-Keen dialect, the province from
whence it was first exported to Europe. The leaf has
always retained its name of tea in the West, notwithstanding
that in Canton, from which port it has been
shipped for nearly 250 years, it is called <i>chā</i>. This
word means the <i>infusion</i>, while <i>chā-yip</i>, analogous to
'leaves for infusion,' is the tea of commerce. The
varieties are very numerous, and are classed under the
heads of <i>black</i> and <i>green</i>. It is only within fifty-five
years that <i>Oolongs</i> and <i>Ankoys</i> have been shipped, and
chiefly to the United States. These are of a light brown
colour. <i>Blacks</i> consisted of <i>Bohea</i>, <i>Congo</i>, <i>Souchong</i>, and
<i>Powchong</i>. The first derives its name from the celebrated
<i>Woo-E</i> Hills of Fuh-Keen; the second signifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
<i>Workmen's</i> tea; the third 'small seeds;' and the fourth
'seeds in bundles,' it having been always done up in
paper packages. <i>Greens</i> were, 1, 'Young Hyson,' 2,
'Hyson,' 3, 'Hyson Skin,' 4, 'Gunpowder,' and 5,
'Imperial.' The first means in Chinese 'before the rains'
(when it was gathered), the second the 'opening of
spring,' and the third the 'refuse or end of the crop.'
The Chinese name of the fourth signifies 'small pearls'
and of the fifth 'large pearls.'</p>

<p>In addition to these were formerly shipped Campoi,
Hung-Muy, Sung-Lo, Caper, and Woping; but they
have now lost their distinctive names, and if shipped at
the present day are merged into other kinds more popularly
known.</p>

<p>The choicest of all teas, and which we saw only on
special occasions, when it came with the annual New
Year presents from the Hong merchants, was 'Padre
Souchong,' so called from its having been grown by the
priests of a famous monastery. The whole quantity
was small; it was put up in canisters of two or three
ounces, and was currently supposed to be sent to the
Emperor. His Celestial Majesty deigned as a rare
favour to present some of it to the most favoured of the
high officers of Government at Pekin, and they in their
turn, as a great compliment, forwarded a portion to the
Hong merchants. This was in return for valuable
watches set with pearls, for clocks, musical snuff-boxes,
or 'smellum water' (as the Chinese call lavender-water
and eau de cologne), which foreign objects it was
customary to send to influential mandarins for favours
in the past and those in prospective.</p>

<p>The following tradition exists as to this peculiar
tea. In spite of the assertion that the entire annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
crop is 'offered up to the reigning Emperor,' it is
brought to Canton, but in a very limited quantity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a deep recess of the Woo-E (Bohea) Hills, surrounded
by shrubbery and trees, almost impenetrable to the human eye,
stands the Temple of the 'Silver Moon.' Its antiquity is so
great that all traces of its origin are lost. The temple has been
inhabited from time immemorial by a family of the 'Tea Sect,'
which, at the period of the year coinciding with the maturity of
the leaves, makes offerings to its patron saint of fine tea.
Close by the temple stand three small tea trees, which are
tended by the family. They produce but <i>one</i> catty each.
These trees were originally planted thousands of years ago by
divine hands, and they have never been known to yield more
nor less than three catties (4-1/3 pounds).</p></blockquote>

<p>The original paper of which this is a translation was
given to me by Pwan-Suy-Lan, with a small canister of
this famous tea; but on asking him if he considered it to
have been originally planted by 'Joss,' he answered,
he thought not, but that 'he own come'&mdash;that is to
say, 'it sprang from the ground spontaneously.' It was
known that the senior Hong merchant received the
greatest quantity of it. As with Pwan-Suy-Lan and
Pwankeiqua, Houqua's family had long been tea planters
in the Bohea Hills, and were so when they first came to
Canton, soon after foreign trade was confined to that port
(as he frequently observed to me), about the year 1750.</p>

<p>Well-to-do Chinese drink black tea, but not usually
<i>new</i> tea. They keep it in closely-shut earthen jars
for a couple of years before using it. This moderates
the acrid or pungent quality which new tea possesses
more or less, and renders it softer and more acceptable
to the taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As if to make all things work comfortably, the
setting in of the south-west monsoon brought foreign
ships to Whampoa to receive cargoes of teas, which
were meanwhile arriving from the interior, from August
to November; and the north-east monsoon, as the ships
loaded and left the port in succession, blew them down
again. The only exceptions were known as 'out-of-season
ships,' of which there were rarely over two yearly.
These came east about <i>viâ</i> Gilolo or Dampier's Straits,
and they took away the last teas of a season. An occasional
ship, trusting to good weatherly qualities, would
take the Palawan passage <i>late</i> in the year, beat up under
the coast of Luconia to Cape Boleno, and then stretch
across the China Sea; but it was dangerous from its
numerous shoals, and a vessel would be dreadfully knocked
about, even if successful. About 1830 or 1831 a bold and
successful attempt to set the north-east monsoon at
defiance was made by the <i>first</i> opium clipper. She was
called the 'Red Rover,' and was commanded by Captain
Clifton, owned at, and from Calcutta. It was considered
a most extraordinary performance.</p>

<p>The earliest shipments of a season were made from
Whampoa by the East India Company, in November
usually. They consisted of contracts made at the end of
the previous year. They could be seen in large quantities
stored in the Hongs, waiting the first ships to come in.
These teas were currently known as 'winter teas,' and
went to keep up the quantity of one year's supply which
the Company was bound by its Charter to keep on hand
in London at all times. Continuous shipments followed,
so that by the end of the year or a little later their vessels
were all away. To the United States green teas were
exported almost solely until about 1828, when the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
blacks were shipped; after that date they became a
feature in the trade. Contracts were made for the new
season's teas, either at fixed prices, or, if it was an object
to get a ship off quickly, then the prices were governed
by those of the opening of the market. The 'opening'
of the tea season was eagerly looked forward to; and such
was the contrast between the busy and the dull season
that during the former we were repeatedly in the offices
until two o'clock in the morning. The seasons of 1830
to 1838 were particularly active ones, and besides business
with India, England, and the West Coast of
America, our own house had frequently at Whampoa at
one time ten to fifteen ships (in the year 1833 twenty-two),
every one loading teas and silks for the United
States, and, after 1833, vessels loading for England as well.
It was during one of these years&mdash;I think 1834&mdash;that we
despatched the <i>first</i> English vessel from Whampoa that
had yet carried a full cargo of free teas to New South
Wales; she was named the 'Royal Saxon,' and was
commanded by Captain Robert Towns.</p>

<p>The final loading of a ship consisted of all sorts of
odds and ends reserved for the last moment, and shipped
off by what was called the 'chow-chow chop.' More
valuable cargo, not ready in time for the regular cargo
boats, could also be sent to Whampoa by this conveyance.
It was a great convenience, while all other shipping
off was conducted on the strictness of the laws of
the Medes and Persians, with documents without flaw.</p>

<p>When the market had been cleared of teas, the
vessels despatched and the business of the season
over, contracts were made with the Hong merchants
for the next season. These contracts were often of
great pecuniary value. They consisted of teas of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
qualities and kinds, in packages of chests and half-chests,
sometimes at fixed prices, at others at the opening
prices after they should have arrived, and deliverable
at the customary time. No other record of these
contracts was ever made than by each party booking
them. No written agreements were drawn up and
signed, nothing was sealed or attested. A wilful breach
of contract never took place, and as regards quantity and
quality, the Hong merchants fulfilled their part with
scrupulous honesty and care. I am speaking of the first
twenty years of my own personal experience.</p>

<p>Entire cargoes of teas were purchased and shipped
from a few small canister musters, and were weighed
by taking the average of a few chests from each
'chop.' A 'chop' of tea was always an uncertain
quantity, blacks numbering 400 to 600 chests, sometimes
more or less, and greens from 120 to 200 chests. The
chest contained originally 100 catties, or 133-1/3 pounds, the
halves and quarters in the same proportion, while boxes
were locally packed with canisters of various sizes. The
inconvenience of these larger packages, both in size and
weight, caused a reduction to be made in them gradually
until the chest averaged about eighty catties. Some of
the packages shipped at this time have completely
disappeared, and we hear no longer of five and ten-catty
boxes, nor of one, two, or three-pound canisters.</p>

<p>Valuable invoices of silk piece goods were bought
and shipped from an examination of only a piece or two
taken at random from any box we might choose to have
opened. They consisted of satins, crapes, sinshews,
levantines, black handkerchiefs, sarsnetts, lutstrings, and
pongees, besides great quantities of yellow nankins,
almost all of which articles have now ceased to be exported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>As a natural consequence of the integrity of the
Chinese merchants, we had neither receipt nor check-book.
Payments were made by the Compradore of large
amounts on simple scraps of paper signed with the initials
of a firm. No promissory notes existed, and consequently
there was no 'bill book.' There was no post office, there
were no postages, and no copying machines.</p>

<p>We had no custom-house business to attend to; our
inward cargoes were landed and stored, and our outward
ones shipped off, by the Linguists, to whom we had but
to intimate in which Hong the former should be landed
or the ship to which the latter were to be sent. All
merchandise was purchased at long price, and all sold
at short price; this was the rule, and saved us an infinity
of trouble. We were under no apprehension as to the
outturn of the quality or weight of the teas and silks
which we shipped. The ingenious process of augmenting
the brilliancy of tea by a clever facing of
'Prussian blue' or 'Chinese yellow,' of adding to the
bulk by an admixture of chopped willow or elm leaves,
of increasing its weight by iron filings, was not yet
practised by those 'heathen Chinee.' Possibly the
absence of these 'industries' formed a very primitive
mode of carrying on business!</p>

<p>On the other hand, we were obliged to make our
own ink (out of powders from England), in which we
resembled the Jews, who arrived in China and settled at
Kae-Fung-Foo any time between <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1122 and 249!
Historians have not settled this point, but they have
ascertained that, whenever it might have been, 'those
people used split bamboos for pens, and at the Feast of
Tabernacles made sufficient ink for the ensuing year'!
Our letters and shipping documents were despatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
under wafer or seal, as no such thing as envelopes yet
existed (they had been in use in China for centuries!),
nor did we enjoy the luxury of postage-stamps. Moreover
every consignee of a ship was his own 'post office' for
all letters brought out by her, and he delivered them to
suit his own convenience. I have known cases in which
outward letters were delivered when the vessel that
brought them was outside the Bogue, homeward bound.
This custom of not always delivering letters on the
arrival of a ship from the United States was mutually
understood, and considered as the privilege of any house.
It can easily be imagined that a New York firm, in
sending the 'Huntress' to a market 12,000 miles away
for a valuable cargo, might suffer greatly in its interests
if she carried letters from a rival house deliverable on
arrival, informing its correspondent that it should
despatch the 'Levant' shortly, give him particulars of
her outward cargo and orders for a return one. Thus
very reasonably, letters were detained until the agent of a
ship had concluded his purchases&mdash;at least he had the
privilege of detaining them. There was, of course,
the chance of the passage out, and the difference that
might result to the quickest ship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a ship had anchored at Whampoa, the pilot
reported her arrival to the Hoppo through a branch
Hoppo station at that place. This would be done, not
by giving the name of the ship, but that of the captain.
Two boats were then made fast to her, to see that no
smuggling was carried on; they were attached one on
each quarter. Meanwhile the agent would select a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Hong merchant to become 'security' for her and a
Linguist to transact her business with the Hoppo's office,
to send boats to bring her cargo to Canton, and to
take to Whampoa her outward cargo, and these were
all the 'official' duties that the agent had to attend
to.</p>

<p>Before she could open hatches, the formality of
'Cumsha and Measurement' had to be gone through.
The first word signifies 'present,' and was a payment
made by the earliest foreign vessels for the privilege
of entering the port; and the second is equivalent
to tonnage duties. On a day of which notice was
given to the agent, a specially appointed mandarin
from the Hoppo's office was sent on board, attended
by pursers and numerous servants. He was always
received with some ceremony, and regaled with wine
and biscuit. As with all the officials, they were men
of a good deal of dignity and ease of manner. The
captain would receive him at the gangway, while all
hands were rigged out in their 'Sunday suits.' After the
ordinary salutations, enquiries as to the passage out, &amp;c.,
the measurement would be made by one of the attendants
attaching the end of a measured tape to the
forward part of the rudder head and running it to
the after part of the foremast, then calling out the
length, which others would note in writing; the breadth
was then taken amidships close abaft the mainmast,
between the plankshears, which being booked, a calculation
was made of the dimensions for duty. As the
details were peculiar I give those of the ship 'Maria'
(Captain Evans), of New York, whose tonnage was about
420 (Canton, June 1830).</p>

<p>Vessels coming to Whampoa with rice only were
subject to the modified port charges of $1,150 up
to the year 1833, but in that year, owing to a great
famine that existed, they were done away with. The
Viceroy Loo then issued a lengthy proclamation, in
which the Hong merchants were ordered to make known
the cessation of those charges to 'all the foreign
barbarians,' 'who would leap for joy, and go backward
and forward in search of rice cargoes.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>The 'Cumsha and Measurement' having been duly
disposed of, a permit was granted for 'opening hatches,'
and the unloading went on uninterruptedly. The outward
cargo was then shipped off, and the vessel ready for
sea. Tea ships exclusively met with no great delay at
Whampoa&mdash;on the average about three months&mdash;but if
silks constituted her homeward lading, frequently six
months passed before they were ready. It then happened
that not a solitary foreign vessel remained at the anchorage;
I have seen this to occur on several occasions.</p>

<p>When finally loaded, application was made through
the Linguist to the Hoppo for the 'Grand Chop.'
This was at once delivered on ascertaining that all
formalities had been fulfilled and duties collected.
It was a large sheet having a broad border, on two
sides of which was the figure of a Dragon (the symbol
of the Celestial Empire). They were always the same
in form, and printed from wooden blocks, with blank
spaces to be filled in with the name of the captain,
number of the crew, list of armament, and date of issue.
The following is a translation of the grand chop of the
ship 'Maria,' Captain Evans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Chung, filling the office of Hoppo by Imperial appointment,
issues this in obedience to his will. When Western Ocean
ships have been measured, paid their duties, and departed,
should bad winds and water drive them to the shores of another
province (not being within the accorded limits of trading),
if it is found that they possess this sealed discharge they must
be allowed to continue their voyage without delay or opposition.
Which is on record.</p>

<p>Now the foreign merchant ship 'Ewan' having loaded
with merchandise, goes to the Hwa-Ke<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> country, there to
manage her business. She has been measured, and duties
incurred by her have all been settled, as customary. As she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>now departing, this is given as a clearance into the hands of
the said merchant to grasp and hold fast, so that, should he
meet with any other custom-house, he must not be detained.
Military stations to which it may be shown must also let the
said vessel pass without interruption, and not induce her to
remain and trade that they may be benefited by any charges
or duties. Should they act otherwise, it will give rise to
trouble and confusion.</p>

<p>According to old regulations, the guns and ammunition
and other arms she carries for her defence are herein enumerated.
An unnecessary quantity is not allowed, nor has she
dared to receive on board contraband articles. Should it have
been discovered that these rules were broken by her, this
permission to sail would assuredly not have been granted.</p>

<p>Respectfully examine this <i>and depart</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Whampoa Compradores</i> who attended upon
American and other foreign ships received their licenses
from the Hoppo's office. They were, like their Canton
brethren, a notable class, and fulfilled for the ships the
same offices as the latter did for the Factories. It was
another illustration of the perfect system that existed,
whereby all having business at the port were aided in
every manner for their own convenience and security.
The Whampoa Compradore for American vessels in eight
cases out of ten was 'Boston Jack'. He was much considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
by his countrymen on the island, and ever civil and
obliging. He had once made a passage to Boston as
steward, and returned to Whampoa, <i>viâ</i> Cape Horn and
the north-west coast of America, in a small schooner of
about 200 tons called the 'Cossack,' on board of which
was Mr. Oliver H. Gordon as supercargo. 'Boston Jack'
was very fond of relating his experiences on board of the
'Cossack,' particularly off the Horn, where, as he would
say, 'too muchee strong gale; sea all same high masthead&mdash;no
can see sky, no can see water,' meaning that in the
turmoil of the elements one could see nothing. By his
countrymen he was looked upon as a very 'great gun;'
he was a favourite with the Americans, and finally died
at a good old age, 'universally regretted' and much
missed!</p>

<p>The grand chop having been received from the
Hoppo, the pilot was obtained at Whampoa. As the
ship got under way, the Compradore's 'cumshas,'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
according to 'olo custom,' were brought on board. They
consisted of dried lychee, Nankin dates (the 'latest
dates,' as they were christened), baskets of oranges, and
preserved ginger; then, amidst a firing off of crackers
attached to the end of a long pole from the Compradore's
boat&mdash;'to awaken the gods to the vessel's departure,' that
they might vouchsafe to her 'good wind and good
water'&mdash;she departed. As in entering the river, she hove
to off Anonghoy Fort at the Bogue, that the pilot could
exhibit his pass. Sailing by Macao, this individual was
cast off, and soon outside, she was rolling down the
China Sea&mdash;homeward bound!</p>

<p>The English East India Company's ships were divided
into two fleets, which came in alternate years. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fleet consisted of about twenty vessels, a certain number
of which were appointed for China <i>viâ</i> Bombay, Madras,
and Calcutta, while the remainder were direct ships.</p>

<p>They were splendid vessels of 1,800 to 2,000 tons.
Some belonged to the Company, others were chartered
usually for a certain number of voyages. Many of them
were built in India of teak. In time of war they sailed
under convoy; the gun-deck then carried a suitable
armament, of which good use was made in several
encounters&mdash;notably in the southern part of the China
Sea, when, under Admiral Duckworth, a French
squadron was beaten off, and on other occasions in the
Bay of Bengal. They sailed under the flag of the Company,
which resembled that of the United States in its
alternate red and white stripes, having for its field the
English Jack. The discipline on board was that of a
man-of-war, and they differed in no respect from one
except that they did not fly the pennant or carry a
special body of marines. Besides the commander, the
officers were six in number, several midshipmen, surgeons,
and purser, together with the usual complement of
warrant officers. Those of the fleet told off for India
conveyed troops and munitions of war, for service in
the Company's possessions there.</p>

<p>No finer sight of the kind could be seen in any part
of the world than the Company's fleet collected at
Whampoa, with their inward cargoes discharged, and
every ship in beautiful order, waiting for teas. Those
formidable vessels were not of the modern clipper model,
but broad-backed, with swelling sides and full bows. On
board everything was neat, everything indicated system,
discipline, and force. The oldest captain (in date) daily
hoisted his pennant as Commodore. Daily one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ship's boats came to Canton in rotation, independently
of others on individual service. The hospitality of the
captains and officers was generous, and, as some of them
had bands on board, it was a treat indeed to be included
amongst the guests. The 'Vansittart's' band even came
to Canton to play in the Factory on one occasion, and
regaled the entire community by playing in the Square.
The music attracted many Chinese also, it being to them
a wonderful novelty. The bandsmen wore a uniform of
red coats. We were all looking on and listening, when
suddenly a Chinaman exclaimed, 'What for he makee
so muchee noisee?' 'Noise!' said one of the barbarians;
'may Fo<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> run away with you&mdash;that no belong noise,
belong music. You no likee?' 'Hae-yah!<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> my how can
likee, all make mixee&mdash;<i>my</i> China music No. 1; <i>he</i>
too muchee foolo!' What he would have added we
couldn't tell, but suddenly he darted off, crying out,
'What for you kick my?' and made the best of his
way up Old China Street. Soon afterwards the crowd
became so numerous and so noisy that to avoid further
'complications' the band was withdrawn inside the
Company's Factory and the Square cleared, and not
very quietly, as the Chinamen's bare heads resounded
with the thwacks which were laid on them, but it took
place with great celerity. That was the first and only
time a foreign band of music was heard to play in the
Square.</p>

<p>Exports by 'country ships' to India consisted of tea,
coarse porcelain, paper umbrellas, silks, and a multitude
of 'chow-chow' articles, together with enormous quantities
of silver and bar gold. For the latter a special
chop, called 'money chop,' had to be obtained from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Hoppo. It was these repeated shipments of treasure
that attracted the attention of the local authorities, and
through whose reports in connection with the foreign commerce
of the port they were made known to the Government
at Pekin. As a natural result, Imperial edicts were
sent down forbidding shipments of such quantities of
money, as being for the purchase of 'foreign mud,' to be
introduced by stealth into the 'Middle Kingdom,' against
prohibitions successively issued, warning all engaged
in the trade 'to desist and not to incur the Imperial
displeasure,' while any Chinese co-operating in it were to
be severely punished. But the immunity so long enjoyed,
with the inherent weakness of the Chinese Government,
caused foreigners to believe that any serious attempt to
put a stop to the trade was simply impracticable. The
Imperial edicts were considered as so much waste paper.
Opium was imported and sold, while 'the oozing out
of fine silver' went on as usual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the 'Outside' Chinese Merchants several were of
much consideration, and of an integrity and intelligence
in business unsurpassed by the mercantile classes of any
other country. Such men were Washing, Cumwa,
Linchong, Wo-Yun, Yeeshing, Keet-Chong, and others.
An incident in relation to Yeeshing, serving as an illustration
both of his honesty and unselfishness, may be
related.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the great fire in 1822, enormous
quantities of private property and of merchandise were
destroyed, and opportunities offered when, without the
possibility of discovery, the latter, particularly, could
have been concealed and reported as having been consumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by the flames. Mr. John P. Cushing, of the house
of Perkins &amp; Co., had placed with Yeeshing 5,000 pieces
of crapes to be dyed, whose value was about $50,000.
There was, of course, no insurance upon them, nothing of
the kind existing at Canton. A day or two after the fire
Yeeshing entered Mr. Cushing's office, exclaiming,'Hae-yah!
Hae-yah!' 'Well, Yeeshing,' enquired Mr. C.,
'how fashion?' To which he replied, 'My have loosum
my house, my shop&mdash;alla finishy, too muchee trub.' Mr. C.
began to express his sympathy, with the conviction that
he too was involved in the loss, when Yeeshing continued,
'My alla finishy, only when my take out you crape (to
save it) hav loosum 84 peecee, how can my, no too muchee
trub?' He had saved Mr. Cushing's crapes, but had
lost his own dwelling and its contents, with an important
quantity of his own goods and chattels, in doing so.</p>

<p>Keet-Chong, named above, possessed an estate on
French Island, on which his family had resided for more
than 800 years. It was of moderate extent, the dwelling
spacious, and, as he used to say, 'all thing no have
changee.' He showed me on one occasion his genealogical
tree (which Chinese families keep with scrupulous
care), and which ascended, according to it, to the Sung
Dynasty (967 to 1281 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). This dynasty immediately
preceded the Yuen, or Mongol Tartar, family, the first
emperor of which was Kublai Khan, grandson of
'Jengis Khan.'</p>

<p>The custom exists among Chinese of not using their
family names in business, either for firms or individuals.
They assume certain designations by which they are
known, are responsible, and recognised by the authorities.
As examples, Houqua, whose family name was
Woo (from which <i>How</i>), was known commercially as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
'Ewo.' Pwantingqua, whose family name was Pwān,
was known as 'Tung Foo,' and the family name of
'Washing' was Moo. The choice of these names is
singularly diversified and sometimes very droll. In
passing through any business street you see on a
small sign attached to a pillar at the side of a door such
firms as 'Peace and Quiet,' 'Current Gains,' 'Collective
Justice,' 'Perfect Concord,' 'United Concord.' I have
seen 'Tan-E' (which means literally 'Solitary Idea'),
'Perfect Record,' 'Three Unities.' Where something of
a more imposing nature is chosen&mdash;as, for instance,
'George and Thomas Sandbank, Sons and Nephews'&mdash;a
double name, such as 'The Record of Perpetual Harmony,'
would be adopted. One is struck with the use
of short inscriptions on narrow sheets of red paper over
doorways, at the foot of stairs, over weights and
measures, everywhere and on everything almost. On
entering an outer door you observe above it, 'May the
Five Happinesses enter the abode' (longevity, riches,
posterity, love of virtue, and a natural death), while
within may be seen, 'May wealth flow in abundantly;'
and not a bad one, 'For idle persons there is no admittance.'
'As wheels revolve, so may supplies and sales
continue;' 'Customers come in numbers, like the
gathering of clouds;' 'Here are sold superior goods, in
whose prices there is no change;' 'Rich customers are
perpetually welcome;' 'Daily may there be weighed
10,000 taels' (May the transactions amount to that
sum); 'From a single cash, may 10,000 be derived'
(these last two may be seen over scales and weights);
and so each object has its peculiar, if not appropriate,
device. You read on each one of a pile of water-tubs,
'The bucket of superlative peace;' on chests, 'The box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of great tranquillity;' over inner doors, 'May happiness
attend the opening of the door;' and over shelves and
drawers, 'When opened, may prosperity follow;' at the
top of a stairway, 'May the going up or down be calm
and peaceful.' On the sterns and bows of boats and
junks you may read, 'Prosperous gales and smooth seas'
(which in Canton jargon is simplified to the usual expression
'Good wind, good water'); 'Grant favourable
breezes;' 'A fair wind is riches;' 'The moon's rays
shine upon and enliven the waters;' 'The dragon's head
produces horns of gold' (an allusion to the bows of a
junk, which are supposed to represent the head with the
large eyes of the dragon), signifying, 'May the voyage
be successful.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first foreign newspaper published at Canton was
in 1827; it was called the 'Canton Register,' and was
printed on a small hand-press lent for the purpose by
Mr. Alexander Matheson, of the then house of Magniac
&amp; Co.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Its size was but a little more than that of a large
sheet of foolscap. The editor, who himself was the first compositor,
was a young American gentleman named Wood,
of Philadelphia, and son of the celebrated tragedian. He
was a person of great versatility, mentally and materially;
he abounded in wit, was well read, and of no fixed purpose.
Having ceased to be connected with the 'Register,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
he entered the office of Messrs. Russell &amp; Co. about the
same time with young Irving, a nephew of Washington
Irving. One day, one of our Parsee friends, Nanabhoy
Framjee, came in for bills on London 'in small
pamphlets' (moderate amounts each), and it was Wood's
business to fill them up. Our office, one of three,
was the general rendezvous of Russell &amp; Co.'s captains,
and on the day in question five or six of them were
present, talking over purchases in carpenter's square
of camphor-wood trunks, lacquered ware boxes, writing
desks, &amp;c. The bills having been made out were
left on Mr. Low's desk for signature. Suddenly from
the 'Tai-Pan's' office we heard a great shout of
laughter, and that gentleman appeared. 'Wood,'
said he, handing him one of the bills, 'I doubt if Baring's
will accept this, or even Nanabhoy take it; read
it over.' Wood did so, and to his confusion saw that
B. B. &amp; Co. were requested to pay to the order of
Nanabhoy Framjee, Esq., 'one hundred lacquered ware
boxes,' which in his absence of mind he had caught
up from the skippers. Not very long after, Wood took
up his quarters in the French Factory, and established a
second newspaper, called the 'Chinese Courier,' which
had but a short existence. Amongst his other accomplishments
was that of sketching, for which he had a
remarkable talent, and he was, moreover, a maker of
verses! One evening at dinner at his house, several
being at table, the conversation ran upon poetry, and
some impromptu verses having been made, something
led to a challenge to Wood to parody Byron's 'Know'st
thou the land,' confining the words entirely to local
matters and things. He accepted the challenge, and
when we again met he read after dinner the following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
on which we congratulated him, as being <i>good</i> for
Canton!</p>

Keating, had at one time a 'little difficulty.' Mr.
Augustine Heard acted for him, and Mr. James Innes,
an 'old school' and eccentric Scotchman, for the latter.
Much correspondence took place between them as to
where the question should be washed out in 'blood.'
One side chose French Island, at Whampoa; the other
Lintin, as being beyond the interference of the Chinese
authorities in case of 'accident;' but through the good
sense of the '<i>best</i> men,' and to the gratification of common
friends, the dispute was arranged&mdash;because, as Wood
said, 'There was no abbey in which to lay a body.'
After a residence of nearly ten years at Canton, Wood
removed to Manila, and established himself on a coffee
and sugar plantation at Jala-Jala. His letters from
this new abode were full of wit and mirthful to a degree,
even in describing bad crops caused by visits from
Messrs. Taiphoon, Drought, &amp; Co., or the destruction
of his fences by wild buffaloes, while he never could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a night's sleep from the many snakes of preposterous
dimensions which made themselves 'at home' in his
bungalow, and pursued the most 'harmless' of rats
across the ceiling, up and down posts, and across the
floors 'under his very eyes.' At length he quitted
Jala-Jala and joined the office of Messrs. Russell &amp;
Sturgis, at Manila. Under their generous auspices and
considerate kindness he ever after found there a home.</p>

<p>He was the first person to introduce the art of
photography in Manila, and through his teaching many
Mestizos<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> became proficients, and practise it now as a
profession. He made one short visit to Europe, from
which he returned delighted, and one to myself at
Macao (thirty years after we first met at Canton). At
length for poor Wood the 'tolling of the bell' was
heard; he died, full of years, after an extraordinary life
of great personal worth, great unsteadiness of purpose,
and, as far as worldly success went, a great unsuccess.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under certain circumstances foreign residents could
'offer up' petitions at the city gates! It was a privilege
that had its origin a long while ago. At the same time
it was discouraged by the authorities, while strict orders
were given to the guards at the gates to keep a sharp look-out
and close them if any number of barbarians were
known to be approaching. This old custom originated in
some question, such as praying for a diminution of duties
(all duties being more or less arbitrary), or for permission
to ship off an extra weight of silks, which was fixed at a
certain number of piculs per vessel,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and called the 'silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
privilege,' or on some matter affecting their personal
comfort. The Co-Hong frequently co-operated with us,
recommended our petitioning, and even themselves made
a draft paper. Answers to these petitions were invariably
received, when the Hong merchants would prepare for
us a rejoinder, if necessary.</p>

<p>Great precautions were taken to keep the intention
as quiet as possible, consequently all who were disposed
to join a party in presenting a petition were advised in
time. None were more anxious to accompany it than
the younger members of the community, who considered
it great fun! To refer to a particular case, directly in
front of the American Factory, at the river side, there
existed a huge mound of earth and rubbish that had its
origin with the great fire of 1822. While the new
Factories were going up and the damaged ones being
repaired the workmen and coolies threw all sorts of
rubbish on the spot. Subsequently it became a depository
of refuse of all sorts, and finally a resort of
loathsome beggars, of whom many died on it; but
beyond obtaining the carrying away of the dead bodies,
all efforts by the foreigners to get the whole thing
removed had proved ineffectual.</p>

<p>The Hong merchants now and then sent a number
of coolies, but they made small impression upon it; and
at length, mostly at their suggestion that it was 'Mandarin
pigeon,' it was resolved to present a petition at the
city gates, which they themselves prepared and we copied.</p>

<p>On the day agreed upon, therefore, the party going
were quietly advised and informed at which gate to meet.
Taking different streets in small numbers of three or four,
all drew towards the 'petition gate,' as we called it, and
suddenly with a rush entered it. The surprise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
guards was complete. They hastily closed the ponderous
outer gate to prevent the Chinese entering and possibly
creating a row. Seeing the petition on red paper held up
above our heads, they knew from experience the object
of our visit, and forthwith despatched a messenger to
the Hoppo's 'Ya-Mun.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Any annoyance caused us
by Chinese lookers-on or by any who tried to crowd
about us called for prompt 'whipping' by the soldiers,
as was always the case, letting foreigners have their
own way, and laying it well over the shoulders of their
own countrymen who attempted any interference or
who did not 'move on' fast enough. It happened that
on a previous occasion of petitioning an unpleasant
incident occurred, which arose from a fancied insult;
blows had been exchanged, and certain words used by
an excited member of the foreign party in reference to
the soldiers became a tradition, 'Knock them down,
friend Olyphant, they are only tea and rice,' and the best
of the joke was that the speaker was a Quaker and
Mr. Olyphant one of the quietest men in the world, and
the last person to strike any one.</p>

<p>Such exhibitions were much to be deplored as
encouraging the belief that foreigners were indeed
'unruly devils'&mdash;a pugnacious, wild, boisterous people.
Presently we heard the sound of the gong and the loud
cries of lictors preceding the Mandarin calling out
his rank and office as well as keeping the street clear.
The space between the large outer and inner gate is the
thickness of the wall, about thirty feet, and twelve to
eighteen feet broad, the quarters of the guard, about
twenty or twenty-five in number, being in recesses on
either side, and in this space petitions are received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The Ta-Yin<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> (great man) having entered with other
Mandarins and attendants, after salutations and surprise
at seeing so many foreigners, they seated themselves
on chairs brought by their followers. He then
commenced by telling us of the extreme impropriety
of entering the gates in opposition to the will of
the 'Son of Heaven,' cautioned us to be wary how
we did the like again, lest we might check the flow
of Imperial benevolence towards all coming from a
distance, &amp;c. &amp;c., which was the usual opening formula,
when a Linguist being found cut and dried on the spot
(sent privately by the Hong merchants), stepped forward,
knelt on both knees, and 'handed up' the petition. In
the meantime it was a strange sight to see the houses,
shop doors, and windows inside the city full to overflow
of Chinese, intently looking on in profound stillness and
curiosity.</p>

<p>His Excellency, having read the paper, said in placing
it in the hands of an officer that a communication would
be sent to the Hong merchants, 'that we must return to
our Factories, be henceforth reverently obedient, when all
would be well, otherwise His Sacred Majesty, Ruler of
all under the Sun, notwithstanding that he was the incarnation
of consideration for all beyond the Western Ocean,
might be provoked to withdraw his beneficent,' &amp;c. &amp;c.
'That the laws of the Celestial Empire must be obeyed,'
and this was the closing formula.</p>

<p>Business being thus ended, a disposition was shown for
a little conversation. Acting as interpreter, I was invited
to speak of the distance of our countries from the 'Celestial
Flowery Land,' how many moons it took to come and
to return; all which was done in laying great stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
upon the clear light of day into which we emerged
as we left our own gloomy shores and approached the
'Middle Kingdom'! Questions were asked as to our
respective nationalities, our names also; and in their
attempts to repeat such as Zacharia, Krieroffski, Burr,
and Brown, they turned to one another and laughed
heartily at their unsuccessful efforts. The teapot and
servants to prepare the infusion being indispensable
in the suite of Mandarins (as well as pipe-bearers), tea
was presently offered to us; we in exchange 'offered
up' Manila cheroots. No one exhibited the slightest
impatience, no matter how many hundreds of Chinese
were obliged, outside or inside, to make great détours to
reach other gates.</p>

<p>The Mandarins being provided with two watches
each, next began a comparison of time; they asked our
ages, how long we had lived within the benign sway of
that 'Almighty Ruler' under whose protecting wings
we found ourselves; and being assured, in reply to
other enquiries, that in our distant countries now and
then a sun, very occasionally two or three moons, with a
rare glimmer of a star, might be seen, they rose from
their seats, took leave, and were soon out of sight. The
great gate was then opened after a violent effort, with a
loud grating of its enormous hinges, and the 'foreign
devils' returned to the Factories, after an hour or two
agreeably passed. The petition in question resulted in
the Hong merchants receiving orders for the immediate
removal of the unsightly mound, of course at their
expense. They were effectually carried out and the
ground was levelled off. It then became the favourite
resort of the Indian servants of Parsee and Moormen
residents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Until the summer of 1829 the most important of the
American houses was that of Perkins &amp; Co. It was the
oldest one existing, without change of name, of all the
foreign firms, having been established soon after a visit
made by Mr. Thomas H. Perkins with two vessels to
Canton in 1798. The house was represented until 1807
by Mr. Bumstead, who was then succeeded by Mr.
Cushing. For comparison with the size of merchant
ships at the present day, it may be noted that this
gentleman came out in the ship 'Levant' (Captain
Proctor), of 264 tons! Mr. Cushing became a partner in
the Boston firm of J. and T. H. Perkins, and managed
that of Perkins &amp; Co., of which he was also a partner
continuously until 1828, without leaving Canton, when
he returned to Boston in the ship 'Milo,' arriving there
on September 17.</p>

<p>To Mr. Cushing succeeded Mr. Thomas T. Forbes,
who, on returning from a visit to Macao in his yacht,
was unfortunately drowned in a taiphoon on August 9,
1829, together with Mr. S. H. Monson, the book-keeper
of Russell &amp; Co. On this sad event taking place,
amongst his papers was found a sealed letter addressed
to Russell &amp; Co. It requested them, in case of accident
to himself, to take charge of the local business of his own
firm, as well as that of J. and T. H. Perkins. They did
so, and naturally came with it that of Houqua, who had
been the intimate personal friend of Mr. Cushing during
his unbroken residence of over twenty years in Canton.</p>

<p>When the news of Mr. Forbes's death reached him,
Mr. Cushing was in England, where the 'Bashaw' (Captain
Pearson), one of the ships of his Boston firm, was
loading for Whampoa. He returned to Canton in her,
arriving in the month of August 1830. Arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were then definitely concluded by which Russell &amp; Co.
were officially appointed sole agents for the Boston house,
that of Perkins &amp; Co. being wound up, while the important
foreign business of Houqua was then also
definitely secured to them.</p>

<p>Towards the close of 'ante-treaty' days, the house
met with a serious loss in the violent death of another
book-keeper, Mr. George C. Perkins, of Boston. He
entered the office as assistant book-keeper,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and subsequently
took charge of that important branch of the
business. He was about thirty years of age, very
systematic and methodical, a well-read man, and of most
agreeable manners. He left Macao on a visit to the
United States, and was returning by the way of San
Francisco to resume the duties of his office. Having
arrived near Hong Kong, he left the ship in which he
had crossed the Pacific, for Macao in a fast boat with
all his baggage. Supposing it to contain gold, coming
from the 'Gold Hills' (by which name California is known
to the Chinese), the cupidity of the boatmen was excited.
They threw Perkins overboard in the Lantao Channel,
and he was drowned. On the event being made known
to the Canton authorities, their search for the boatmen
was so energetic that they were soon discovered in the
midst of a number of fast boats anchored in Anson's
Bay, and beheaded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The year 1830 was an unprecedented one in the
annals of foreign life at Canton, by reason of the coming
to the Factories of several English and American ladies
from Macao, in 'direct opposition to old regulations.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The Mandarins were thoroughly at their wits' ends by
so extraordinary an occurrence. 'Chops' began to circulate
freely. The ladies were ordered to leave forthwith,
and without one moment's delay, otherwise the
'Son of Heaven,' 'so considerate for all beyond the sea,'
would withdraw his compassion, and, and&mdash;in fact, had the
world been coming to an end, the authorities could not
have been more thoroughly alarmed. In a letter written
at the time, I find the following, dated April 8, 1830:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Went in the morning to the 'Company's' chapel with
several Americans to hear the Rev. Mr. Vachell preach, and
to see the 'foreign devil females,' as the Chinamen call them.
They were Mrs. Baynes, wife of the Chief of the Factory,
Mrs. Robinson, and Mrs. Fearon, but <i>she</i> is the beauty
of the party! Mrs. B. was dressed in true London style,
which, much admired by us, is considered 'frightful' by the
Chinese. It was quite a strange thing to see foreign ladies in
the 'Celestial Empire,' an occurrence which had never before
taken place! After a few days they left, but not until the
mandarins threatened to stop all trade!</p></blockquote>

<p>On November 12 of the same year I find the
following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What will Canton turn into, and where will bachelors find
rest? Nowhere. Mrs. and Miss Low and other ladies are at this
moment here! The second day after they arrived several old
codgers were seen in immense coats, which had been stowed
away in camphor trunks for ten or fifteen years, and with huge
cravats on, and with what once were gloves, on their way to
make visits!</p>

<p><i>13th.</i>&mdash;Called on the Tai-Pan's wife and niece, and entertained
them with descriptions of local worthies such as
'Houqua,' 'Mouqua,' and 'Gowqua,' 'Man-Hop,' 'Wa-Hop,'
and 'Tung-Hop'&mdash;a jumble they had never heard of, and
names that amused them immensely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p><i>22nd.</i>&mdash;Evening Church service at Talbot's, the Consul, at
No. 1 American Hong. The ladies and a good number of
gentlemen present. At half-past nine we accompanied the
former to show our fashionable street, Old China Street, its
shops shut at that hour; but some Chinamen passing
began to cry out, 'Foreign devil women!' when instantly
every door was opened and lanterns appeared. In less than
ten minutes we were completely surrounded, and had to beat a
hasty retreat. We were not at all molested; it was simply
surprise and curiosity; and on arriving at the gate of the Hong
everyone quietly dispersed.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;The Chinese are not so far out in calling us barbarians.
Two or three from No. 2 Suy-Hong called on the
ladies. Coats, gloves, and cravats&mdash;such cravats! I heard
one say when he returned, 'Thank God that is over!' and
then call for jacket and black neck-ribbon! He next lighted
a cheroot, and looked as if a great burthen were off his mind.
In the evening dined at Charles N. Talbot's; all bachelors, of
course! A fine little party; but I dissipated too much, and
the sooner bedtime comes the better. Bad habit of dining out
in this country; I think I shall swear off, no getting home
without being observed! I hope the ladies in No. 1 did not
see me come in!</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;The ladies took their departure this evening. They
went on board the boat that was to convey them, escorted
by all the American gentlemen. While returning from Jackass
Point an inveterate bachelor said, 'I hope we shall never be
<i>bothered</i> with ladies in Canton again!' but he was a notoriously
crusty old fellow.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having lost a fine retriever named Rover, and an
English friend a small pug named Bop, I caused a
'reward-card' to be posted on the walls of Chungqua's
Hong. As these 'cards' have a peculiar phraseology, I
give a translation of the one in question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the 10th day of the 1st moon of the present year two
foreign dogs strayed, one from the Suy-Hong and one from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>the Dutch Hong, and have not been seen to return. Long
ears and a long tail adorned the one, which had also a brown
star on its breast, the body being of the colour of 'fragrant
ink.' The other was a small dog, with cropped ears and a tail
of no length. His body was spotted in variegated colours of
brown and white. The larger dog was named 'Lo-Wā,' and
the smaller 'Pŏ-Pā.'</p>

<p>This is to give notice that should any 'superior man' know
where they are, or if they have been 'misled,' and will inform,
he shall be rewarded with <i>flowered red money&mdash;two great rounds</i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
for the big one, and one great round for the little one. Even
should they have been <i>stolen</i> (<i>an inconceivable thing!</i>), if the
person who took them will bring them to Suy-Hong No. 2 he
Shall still be rewarded, and clemency used towards him. This
placard is real; its words will not be eaten.</p>

<p>
Taou-Kwang: 14th year, 15th day, 1st moon.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poor dogs were never found, and the Compradore
insisted upon it that 'some man hav chow-chow he,'<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and
we supposed so too.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On February 27, 1831, Mr. Russell and Mr. Cushing
took their final leave of Canton in the 'Bashaw' (Captain
Pearson), for Boston, the former with the satisfaction
of having founded a house in that distant port which,
under his sagacious management, had secured the confidence
and consideration of the entire foreign and Chinese
mercantile community, as well as of its numerous foreign
correspondents in all quarters of the world. Its present
world-wide reputation renders it needless to say that
it still exists, and has become one of the oldest, if not <i>the</i>
oldest firm whose style has undergone no change eastward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the Cape of Good Hope. Mr. Russell was a
native of Middletown, Connecticut, a person of singularly
gentle and benevolent disposition. There was about
him a suavity and charm of manner which under no
circumstances ever deserted him. Throughout a long
life he enlisted the esteem and respect of all who knew
him. Of his considerate forbearance under great provocation
I can vouch from personal experience. From
my first entrance in the office he was desirous that I
should make myself acquainted with book-keeping. Its
mysteries he first taught me. However incorrectly the
tyro appreciated the relative bearing of successive transactions
or bungled in recording them, he was corrected
with a patience and kindliness of manner that knew no
bounds, and the encouragement he thus received at
length led him to a clear idea of the respective value of
debit and credit, as well as to the knowledge that they
were 'the two factors which formed the base of all mercantile
transactions.'</p>

<p>The younger members of the office, as a slight testimony
to the paternal kindness which they had received
from their worthy 'Tae-pan,' invited him to dine with
them, to consider himself as their guest, at a 'parting
dinner.' He graciously accepted, and seemed pleased at
the idea. We invited Mr. Cushing and his old friend
Houqua. The latter could not be present, but sent us a
very choice bird's-nest soup for the occasion. We sent to
Manila for a <i>fine</i> turkey, and on its arrival put it out to
board on Honam, with injunctions that it should be well
fed. The turkey was a very rare bird at Canton and
supplies came from Manila. Ours looked rather haggard
on arrival, and the Compradore attributed it to its being
'very tired,' but added that it would be No. 1 when killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
fat and presentable. The day came, and with it the
dinner. At the proper moment a great dish was
placed upon the table and the cover removed in a
triumphant way, only to exhibit, to our horror, a lot of
legs and wings of the turkey, but as to body next to
nothing!</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable feature of Old Canton life
was the 'Factory,' as the common dwelling and common
place of business of all the members, old and young, of a
commercial house. The system begat mutual confidence.
All affairs, past, present, and future, were discussed at
the table, and became as familiar to the clerks as they
were to the partners. While the latter imparted their
own views and experiences, the former benefited by
them. The knowledge thus acquired was applied,
each in his special department, to a more intelligent
co-operation, which contributed to a general harmony in
current affairs or special enterprises. And so also in
regard to other subjects. The younger members had
the advantage through this daily 'family' intercourse of
acquiring much useful information on a diversity of
subjects. There were few if any Principals, who had not
had in different parts of the world experience of men
and things, who had not adventures to relate&mdash;how
unexpected difficulties were overcome or chance advantages
availed of. In daily exercises or pastimes all
associated together; whether for walking, for boating, or
sight-seeing, 'Tae-Pans' and 'pursers' shared them
together. Should one of the former take the helm to-day,
and one of the latter an oar, to-morrow saw the
order reversed.</p>

<p>At length, as the elders retired, leaving, as was always
the case, vast and important affairs in course of execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they did so with the conviction that their successors
possessed the qualifications to carry them on to a logical
termination, as well as to initiate new ones.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before leaving us Mr. Russell had placed me in
charge of the books and accounts. We were excessively
busy during the year, as, in addition to orders for teas,
those for manufactured silks were unprecedentedly large.
In May I was on the sick list; Doctor Bradford<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> sent me
to Macao in July for change of air, whence I returned in
October. A serious relapse took place in December, and,
as a 'last chance,' passage was taken for me in a small ship
called the 'Howard,' of about 400 tons, for New York.
It was supposed the 'sea air' might have a good effect.
I was carried to the ship in such a state as to leave
small hope of reaching New York alive. We sailed from
Whampoa early in February 1832. (To replace me in
the office, George R. Sampson was engaged, afterwards
Sampson &amp; Tappan, Boston.) Down the China Sea the
weather and progress were good; we passed out into the
Indian Ocean between Pulo Crockatoa and Prince's
Island, which took us ten days. We had a light 'trade'
to the Cape; there we were met by a succession of
north-westerly gales, which detained us twenty-two
days. We were becalmed on the Equator a long time;
but at length arrived at New York, on the 162nd day,
my health perfectly restored.</p>

<p>I was delighted to meet again Mr. Samuel Russell,
then at the 'Clinton Hotel,' as genial and kindly as
always. He asked me to breakfast, to meet Mr. Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Coolidge, Junior, about to leave for the office at Canton,
and afterwards I was invited to make him a visit at
Middletown, where I had the pleasure to make the
acquaintance of Mrs. Russell, a charming, quiet lady,
whose reception of me was of the kindest.</p>

<p>The 'Roman' was now again fitting out for Canton,
under my old shipmate, Captain Lavender. He had
made several voyages in the 'America,' belonging to
Mr. Thomas H. Smith. Mr. Olyphant consented to
my going in the ship, and there was no other passenger
on board. It was not yet the usage for China ships to
take passengers, nor would they take general letters.
We sailed on October 25, 1832, after a very short stay
at home. This time we took the Gilolo passage into the
Pacific. At five <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> of March 5, 1833, we made Fo-Ki
Point, on the coast of 'teas, silks, and cassia,' and at 5.30
P.M. anchored under the peak of Lantao, in the Lantao
Channel, in 131 days' passage. Lavender despatched a
fast boat to his agents at Canton, Messrs Olyphant
&amp; Co., advising his arrival, while I took another and
arrived at the Factories in the evening of the 9th.</p>

<p>Thus ended a second 'run home' (as those trips
were euphemistically called) of a year each. These
'runs,' however, were in reality nine months of listening
to 'what the wild waves were saying,' 'and wandering
about at home,' unknowing and almost unknown, for
three months; to being subjected, while there, to sleep
on mattresses and pillows filled with feathers in the
summer months, with the thermometer at any height
you please, instead of on the clean, cool, hard rattan
mat or mattress of bamboo shavings, as in Canton, where
it was rarely over 96° at midnight.</p>

<p>It was not until eleven more years had passed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I took another 'run.' This was from Macao in 1844 in
the 'Prince of Wales,' of Bombay (Captain Jones), to
Galle, then in the steamer 'Seaforth,' from Colombo, <i>viâ</i>
Cannanore and Mangalore, to Bombay, with a trip to
Mahableshwar and Poonah for 'sight-seeing;' then to
Aden and back to Bombay in the East India Company's
steamer 'Atalanta;' thence to Macao, <i>viâ</i> Singapore,
in the splendid new clipper 'Mohr' of about 280 tons,
belonging to Messrs. Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co., and
commanded by 'my old friend,' Fraser, who was
second officer of the 'Good Success' in 1825, to
Singapore.</p>

<p>At the end of 1833 we had the misfortune to lose
our estimable chief Mr. W. H. Low, whose health failed
from incessant application to the duties of his responsible
position. He took passage in the Company's ship
'Waterloo,' for England, with his family, and some
months after we heard of his death at the Cape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same year was notable for the hitherto unprecedented
event of the marriage at Macao of a young
American lady, Miss Shillaber, of Boston, to Doctor
Thomas R. Colledge, of the Company's 'Factory.' It
was a brilliant affair, and celebrated with more than
usual éclat from its novelty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The quitting of Canton by the Honourable East
India Company in 1833 was succeeded by the arrival
of Lord Napier on July 25, 1834, as 'Chief Superintendent
of the English Trade.' His lordship landed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a boat belonging to the country ship 'Fort William.'
This vessel being secured by the Hong merchant 'Sun-Shing,'
he was held responsible, conducted into the
city and imprisoned. As Her Majesty's representative
declined to correspond with the Viceroy through the
Hong merchants, the latter issued a proclamation on
September 5, in which he spoke of this 'contumacy'
as a breach of the existing laws and regulations of
the Empire&mdash;of his Lordship having come to Canton
officially, without the permission of His Imperial Majesty,
and requested him to return to Macao pending a reference
to Pekin; adding that, if he refused to leave for Macao,
no Chinese should serve him in any capacity. The proclamation
being pasted on a thin board, was suspended
at the gate of his Lordship's (the East India Co.) Factory
and guarded by about twenty soldiers. No sooner was
this done, than the Chinese within the building, half
frightened to death, and fearing that the soldiers would
enter, rushed upstairs and reported what had taken place.
Lord Napier, who was at dinner with Sir George Best
Robinson and others, instantly left the table and came
down to the gate. The proclamation was at once removed,
and, apprehensive of something serious, Lord Napier
despatched a messenger to Captain Blackwood, of H.M.S.
'Imogene,' then outside the Bogue, to send him a
guard of a dozen marines, and to come with his own
vessel and her consort, the 'Andromache,' to Whampoa
with all despatch. This being done, his lordship retired
inside the Factory with his suite, and the gate was
bolted. At midnight Sir George left Canton in a
small cutter to join the two frigates. Very soon the
marines arrived at the Factory, the Square was filled
with Chinese soldiers, and war junks and boats were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
gathered on the river. All communication with the
Whampoa shipping was cut off, and orders were issued
that no English boats should come to the city. The
Viceroy had also requested the American merchants
not to allow boats from their vessels to come up except
on urgent business. It is needless to add that the whole
foreign trade of the port was entirely stopped. At the
time the disturbance took place, one of our captains,
Hepburn, of the ship 'Nile,' was in the Factory, and
having been assured by the Linguist that he should be
provided with a Chinese boat to take him to Whampoa,
had sent his own back to the ship. On the 6th, when
ready to start, we found that the Linguist could not
procure one. I therefore ordered my own, a small
schooner yacht, the 'Ferret,' to be made ready, and
together we left Canton at four in the afternoon. We
passed through a fleet of about fifty war boats, filled
with men and armed to the teeth. Presently, to our
surprise, we met a small English cutter, having on board
Captain St. Croix, of the 'Alexander Baring,' just
arrived from London, on his way up with our despatches.
I told him it was useless to attempt to get through, and
brought him with us to the 'Nile.'</p>

<p>The next day, September 7, Mr. Coolidge, Mr.
A. A. Low, and Mr. Cabot made their appearance; they
had pulled down for the 'Baring's' letters, having heard
of her arrival soon after I left. The 'Union' schooner
next hove in sight, coming from Macao, with Mr. George
R. Sampson and a Dutch gentleman, Mr. Vandermulen,
on board. I took them out and brought them to the
'Nile.'</p>

<p>Later in the day, Coolidge, Low, and Cabot started
with the 'Baring's' letters, in the hope of being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
get to the Factories; but on arriving at 'Houqua's' Fort,
about half-way, first one and then another ball flew
over their heads, which brought them to. A war boat
came alongside, with a Linguist on board; he told them
it was useless to attempt going on, as, owing to these
troubles with the English, the Viceroy had issued an
additional order, that to prevent 'the innocent from
suffering with the guilty,' no foreign boat could come to
Canton. They pulled back to the 'Nile.' We found
ourselves, therefore, all prisoners at Whampoa, including
another American, named Gorham. We styled ourselves
'the Canton refugees,' and threw ourselves upon the
hospitality of our friends the captains of the six
American vessels then at the anchorage. And this
rather eventful day closed with a dinner on board the
'Coliseum' (Captain Stoddard), with whist in the
evening on board the 'Nile.' The next day we dined
on board the 'India' (Captain Cook, of Salem), and
quartered ourselves upon our friends as follows:&mdash;Coolidge,
Vandermulen, and myself, on board the 'Nile;'
Low on board the 'York;' Cabot, Sampson, and
Gorham, on board the 'Coliseum.'</p>

<p><i>September 26.</i>&mdash;At last we have safely arrived back at
our old quarters in the Factories, after being 'refugees'
at Whampoa for just twenty days. The commotion
is still great, and we are cautioned about going far
from 'home.' The streets are full of rowdies and blackguards,
who abuse us in words far from complimentary,
and make signs as if beheading us! Nevertheless we
are comfortable enough as far as 'Jackass Point' or
Hog Lane, and can look up 'Old China Street' without
bodily fear.</p>

<p>The return to Canton immediately after 'hostilities'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
had ceased by the departure of Lord Napier was worth
making, if only to see the enormous preparations that
had been made against an attempt by the boats of the
frigates. We took the Junk river passage, and met with
no obstructions until we had passed Houqua's Fort and
got abreast of the 'Lob Creek' Pagoda. Here we were
brought to and ordered to pull alongside of a large
mandarin boat, crowded with a ferocious looking lot of
fellows, and half-starved as well, to judge from the
avidity with which they seized upon some biscuit we
threw among them. We were in two boats&mdash;one with
Captain Tonks, of the Bombay ship 'Lord Castlereagh,'
Mr. Low, and Sampson, and my own small gig, with
myself alone. A petty officer, wearing an opaque white
button, got in Tonks's boat and directed him to a junk,
on board of which was a Linguist, and I followed. We
reached the Factories four and a half hours from
Whampoa.</p>

<p>Correspondence between the Hong merchants (as
intermediaries of the Viceroy) and Lord Napier, which his
lordship would not comply with, was the only mode that
could be expected under the existing foreign and Chinese
relations. The Viceroy could not set aside that yet unrepealed
system, nor enter into personal communication
with any foreign representative. To do so, special authority
from the Imperial Government was indispensable.
The entire difficulty therefore was caused by Her Majesty's
representative persisting in requiring of the Viceroy
that which the latter could not grant. Naturally, the
'Napier War,' or, as locally called, the 'Napier fizzle,' was
the result. It was coupled, too, with an entire stoppage
of all foreign trade from September 2 to September 24,
which was a very serious thing, and entirely unjustifiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in the absence of a declaration of war. The mortifying
result was that Lord Napier had to renounce
his expressed determination to remain at Canton.
The British Government should either have obtained
official recognition from Pekin for their representative,
or simply have appointed a Consul whose dignity could
not have been infringed upon by his being placed on
the same footing as Consuls of other foreign nations.</p>

<p>On September 21 Lord Napier quitted Canton with
his suite for Macao. As the frigates proceeded towards
the Bogue and Lintin, so did the two chop-boats of
Lord Napier, <i>pari passu</i>, towards his destination by the
inner passage. He was convoyed by several Chinese
men-of-war boats. At length his Lordship arrived on
the 26th. The humiliating end of his ineffectual
attempt to correspond directly with the local government
aggravated an illness brought on by the vexation
and excitement he had undergone from the day of his
landing from the 'Fort William's' boat, and on October
11 his Lordship died at Macao.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The years 1835 and 1836 were unmarked by any
event out of the regular course. The business of the
house was taking a great extension (purely as agency);
but in 1837 occurred the failures in London of three
important banking houses having a large American
connection. We had negotiated their 'credits' for some
of our constituents to a considerable amount for the
payment of teas and silks. Those houses were Thomas
Wilson &amp; Co., George Wildes &amp; Co., and Timothy
Wiggin, commonly known as the three W's. These
failures were within a short time of each other. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
reference to our register of bills drawn, we found the
total amount of which we had not yet received advice
of payment or acceptance to be close upon 200,000<i>l.</i>
They were all drawn on 'clean credits,' without
'collaterals' (which were not yet in vogue), and at six
months' sight. We had confidence in our American
constituents, but as the shipments occupied, say, four
months in getting to market, and could only be sold at
the usual credit of six months, very little margin of
time existed. Our own credit, however, was the first
consideration. One of our partners, then in Boston, had
in his charge a very large amount belonging to Houqua,
who gave us an order on the former to hold at our
disposal any sum required. Enclosing this, we directed
remittances to be made to Messrs. Barings of a sufficiency
to cover all such bills on the W's as could not
be relied upon for payment by those for whose accounts
they had been drawn, and simultaneously we informed
Messrs. Barings that remittances would be made to them
to provide for such bills, so that our signature could be
promptly honoured.</p>

<p>Communication with the Western world was long
in those days; there were even no 'clipper' ships yet.
Accustomed, however, to such delays, we waited
patiently the result. Our first advices were from
London. They informed us that the writers, Messrs.
B. B. &amp; Co., would honour all bills bearing our name
on the three bankrupt houses in question. This was a
gratifying thing, as they had not yet received our communication
above referred to. Everything worked with
regularity. Some of the firms for whose accounts the
bills had been drawn were ready to meet them, others
furnished securities, and the ultimate loss was inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
on the whole account. So rapid had been remittances
from our Boston partner that, when the final
account current was received at Macao from London,
1840-41, the balance of interest was in our favour,
while Houqua was recouped in full as payments were
made to our home partner by American constituents.</p>

<p>If I am not very much mistaken, 1837 was the first
of those years ending with '7' which have become
proverbial as attended with great commercial troubles
in the Western world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the year 1838 (November) Mr. William Jardine
took his departure from Canton. He founded in 1832
the house of Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co., on the closing
up of that of Magniac &amp; Co., which until then had
been under the management of Mr. Hollingworth
Magniac. Mr. Jardine had been a surgeon in the
marine service of the Honourable East India Company,
and had made several voyages to Bombay and
China. He had made the acquaintance of the celebrated
'Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy,' that prince of Eastern
merchants, that philanthropist&mdash;the building of the
hospital which now bears his name, and the construction
of the Bund from the island of Bombay to
Basseen, being amongst the numerous works which
were carried out at his own expense for the comfort and
welfare of his countrymen. He was, moreover, the first
native inhabitant of the Presidency, and I think of
India, on whom was conferred the dignity of Baronet
by the British Government. The business transactions
of Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy with Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co.
became of a colossal scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The vast commercial operations of Mr. Jardine
Seemed to be conducted with sagacity and judgment.
He was a gentleman of great strength of character
and of unbounded generosity. To him belongs the
shipping of the first cargo of 'free teas' to London, at
the end of the two hundred years of close monopoly
of the East India Company. As a peculiarity of his
character, it may be mentioned that, in his own private
office in the Creek Factory, a <i>chair</i> was never seen&mdash;a
hint to any who may be bothered with gossips or idlers
during business hours!</p>

<p>A few days before Mr. Jardine's departure from
Canton, the entire foreign community entertained him at
a dinner in the dining-room of the East India Company's
Factory. About eighty persons of all nationalities, including
India, were present, and they did not separate
until several hours after midnight. It was an event frequently
referred to afterwards amongst the residents, and
to this day there are a few of us who still speak of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Jardine was succeeded in the management of
the house by Mr. (the late Sir James) Matheson, who
finally left China on March 10, 1842, after a residence
of about fifteen years. He was a gentleman of great
suavity of manner and the impersonation of benevolence.
As the 'Chinese Repository,' in noting his
departure from Macao, said: 'On his leaving the foreign
community lost one of its most enterprising, able, and
liberal members.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On February 26, 1839, execution of a Chinese,
said to be an opium-dealer, took place in front of the
American Factory. The officers had chosen the hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the afternoon when nearly all the foreigners were
away in their daily walks or on the river. The man
was tied up and strangled in a twinkling, and all had
rapidly returned up Old China Street with the body.
On landing from our boats we found the few who
had not been away collected in the Square, and heard
from them what had happened. The only public
notice that could be taken of this affair was to discontinue
the daily hoisting of the national flags before our
doors; nor were they re-hoisted until March 22, 1842.</p>

<p>The appointment of a 'Kin-Chae', or Imperial
Envoy, to Canton, for the express purpose of putting a
stop to the opium trade, had now become known. This
appointment&mdash;only made on an occasion calling for
extreme measures&mdash;was conferred upon Lin-Tsih-Soo,
and involved control not only over all the Canton
authorities, but those of the southern and south-eastern
provinces. His Excellency 'Lin' was the son of an
independent gentleman of Tseuen-Chow in the province
of Fuh-Keen who lived on the revenues of a porcelain
manufactory, in which he himself had worked as a day
labourer it was said.</p>

<p>The 'Kin-Chae' at length arrived at Canton on
Sunday morning, at half-past eight o'clock of March 10.
Two gentlemen and myself went on board of a small
schooner lying off the Factories to witness his arrival.
He was seated on board of a large official boat, with a
few red- and blue-button Mandarins standing a little to
the rear, so that we had an excellent view of him personally.
He had a dignified air, rather a harsh or firm
expression, was a large, corpulent man, with heavy
black moustache and long beard, and appeared to be
about sixty years of age. His own boat was followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
by a great many others, on the sides of which, on a
black ground, were painted in gold letters the rank of
the principal occupants, while flags of various colours
were displayed abaft. The crews were neatly dressed
in new uniforms of red trimmed with white, and conical
rattan hats of the same colours. These boats contained
the principal officers of the city, civil and military,
from the Viceroy to the Superintendent of the Salt
Department. The walls of the 'Red Fort,' nearly
opposite the Factories on the Honam shore, were lined
with soldiers, as were those of the 'Dutch Folly,'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> arrayed
in bright new uniforms. Both shores of the river, every
door and window, and every spot of standing ground,
were thick with people. Everyone was observing the
novel scene quietly and as curiously as ourselves. No
other boat of any description was moving about; all
were lying close to the shores, and a universal silence
prevailed. Besides my companions and myself, not a
'foreign barbarian' was to be seen in the vast gathering.</p>

<p>On the 17th the Hong merchants, the Linguists, and
the Compradores (except our own) were summoned
to an audience of the 'Kin-Chae.' They obeyed it
with fear and trembling. The object was to ascertain
who, amongst the foreigners duly registered as occupying
the Factories, and whose names had been forwarded
to Pekin eighteen months before, were still present and
in the opium 'business.' Russell &amp; Co. not having
been included, our Compradore was not 'invited,' at
which he appeared particularly delighted.</p>

<p>On the 18th the Kin-Chae sent for the Hong merchants.
They were charged with having connived at the
opium trade, and his Excellency threatened to strangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
some of them if it was not <i>instantly</i> put a stop to!
They were also accused of allowing foreign dealers in
'smoke' to reside in their Factories, and were very
much frightened, as one of them said, 'No hav see so
fashion before.' Forthwith they met in 'Consoo' to
deliberate, and remained until late in the night.</p>

<p>On the same day the first edict from the 'Kin-Chae'
to foreigners was issued. It ordered all Opium held
by them to be surrendered, and that they should sign
bonds to discontinue the trade, 'under penalty of death.'
It became very clear that his Excellency was not to be
trifled with.</p>

<p>On the 19th, Messrs. Matheson, Dent, Green, Wetmore,
Dadabhoy Rustomjee, and Daniell met the Hong
merchants at the Consoo House, and were informed
by them verbally of the commands of the 'Kin-Chae,'
which were a repetition of the foregoing, with the
addition that the opium was to be destroyed. Moreover,
if his Excellency's orders were not complied with,
the consequences would be serious. There were at this
time 15,000 chests on board of the 'receiving ships' at
Lintin, and 5,000 chests at the coast stations, and the
cost of all over $12,000,000.</p>

<p>The foreign community thought to propitiate the
'Kin-Chae,' after the receipt by them of his '<i>unalterable</i>'
commands, by offering to give up a <i>certain</i> quantity.
This had been suggested by the Hong merchants, who,
no more than ourselves, supposed the 'Kin-Chae' to
be serious in insisting upon <i>all</i> that was held. A
meeting was therefore convened in the Danish Hong,
on the night of March 21, at which nearly everyone
was present, as were also the Hong merchants, who
assembled in an adjoining room. They were as anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as we were to avert the threatened troubles, should the
'Kin-Chae' not listen to 'reason,' as they expressed it.
In fact, throughout, while we were prisoners in the
Factories, as will be seen, for six weeks, under threat
of death and constant, unheard-of pressure, they did
what they could to alleviate our condition through
appeals to the 'authorities of the City.' All this was
done with very great risk to themselves. Their presence
at the meeting was from a desire to know the decision
to which it might come, that they could report it to
the 'Kin-Chae' as quickly as possible, and, in fact,
we saw by his reply that it had been made known
to him between five and seven on the morning of
the 22nd.</p>

<p>An hour or two before the meeting, Houqua made
his appearance at our office, and requested Mr. Green,
the then chief, to add 150 chests of opium to the
quantity he intended to offer on behalf of Russell &amp;
Co. to the general subscription, for which he himself
would pay. The cost of these chests would have been
$105,000! The gentlemen present at the meeting, on
behalf of their firms subscribed 1,034 chests in all,
of the value of $725,000. These were offered to the
'Kin-Chae,' but disdainfully refused. All communication
with the shipping at Whampoa was then cut off;
quantities of soldiers collected near the Factories, as
well as on the river, while several days before, all the
gates opening to the rear of the Factories had been
bricked up.</p>

<p>Before the promulgation of the 'Kin-Chae's' proclamation
to foreigners, I was invited by the senior Hong
merchant to translate from English into Chinese a communication
that had been prepared by his Excellency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
conjointly with the Viceroy<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and Lieutenant-Governor of
Canton, addressed to Her Majesty the Queen of England.
This arose from the original having been translated into
English, and the Imperial Envoy was desirous to judge
for himself if the latter version conveyed the sense of
the Chinese. Having consented, I passed four hours of
a very cold day at the Consoo House in accomplishing
the task. There were present a delegate from the Commissioner,
a Mandarin of the fourth rank (light blue
button), an inferior officer, Houqua's grandson, Mouqua
and Kingqua, and two Linguists. The document was
a most extraordinary one. Prominent is the bombastic
style, the outcome of ages of dominion, ignorance of
Western official forms through an absence of diplomatic
intercourse. It said: 'In dealing in opium, regardless of
the injury it inflicts upon the Chinese people, an inordinate
thirst for gain controls the actions of these foreign
merchants.' With an idea that the use of it was prohibited
in England: 'We have heard that England
forbids the smoking of opium (within its dominions)
with the utmost rigour; hence it is clear that it is deleterious.
Since, then, the injury it causes has been averted
from England, is it not wrong to send it to another nation,
and especially to China?' Then there is an appeal to
personal feeling: 'How can these opium-sellers bear to
bring to our people an article which does them so much
harm, for an ever-grasping gain? Suppose those of
another nation should go to England and induce its
people to buy and smoke the drug&mdash;it would be right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
that You, Honoured Sovereign, should hate and abhor
them. Hitherto we have heard that You, Honoured
Sovereign, whose heart is full of benevolence, would not
do to others that which you would not others should do
to yourself.' The grandiloquent then appears: 'Our
great Emperor maintains Celestial lands and foreign
nations in equal favour; he rewards merit and punishes
vice; and, as is the heart of heaven and earth pure and
incorruptible, so is his own. The Celestial Dynasty
rules over ten thousand<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> nations, and in the highest
degree sheds forth its benign influence with equal
majesty.' This is in the sense of grandeur or stateliness.
It ended thus: 'By manifesting sincere and
reverential obedience<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> mutually will be enjoyed the
blessings of great peace! Heaven will protect your
Majesty; the Gods bless you, lengthen your years, and
grant you a happy and an honourable posterity.' I never
heard if this document reached its destination.</p>

<p>On March 23, every Chinaman in the Factories, from
the Compradore to the cook, left by order of the
'Kin-Chae,' and were threatened with decapitation if they
dared to return. The day before, Mr. Lancelot Dent,
chief of Messrs. Dent &amp; Co., had been <i>invited</i> to enter
the city and meet his Excellency, which he declined to
do. Other but ineffectual attempts by the authorities
to induce him to go were also made, when, on the 24th,
Captain Charles Elliot, Her Majesty's Superintendent of
Trade, arrived from Macao, and immediately assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
charge, on behalf of the English residents, of the perplexing
question of the 'total surrender of the opium.' The
street in rear of the Factories was now filled with soldiers,
a strong guard was also placed in the 'Square,' and a
triple cordon of boats drawn up from the Creek to the
Danish Factory. The whole community were thus prisoners
in the hands of the Chinese. Provisions were not
allowed to be brought in, no one was permitted to go
beyond the 'Square,' and matters assumed a decidedly
serious aspect. We overcame the difficulty of provisions
in this way. The Chinese soldiers being entirely unaccustomed
to foreigners, there was a danger that 'trouble
would arise;' the Hong merchants therefore represented
this to the City authorities, and offered to send their <i>own
coolies</i> to keep watch at the different gates of the Factories.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
This was agreed to, and the double object was
gained in supplies of firewood and provisions, which
were at night stealthily brought to us by them.</p>

<p>On March 27, on the 'Kin-Chae's' demand to Her
Majesty's Superintendent 'that all the opium under the
control of the English merchants should be given up,'
20,283 chests were tendered and accepted, and 'Chunpee'
fixed upon as the place of delivery. To control the
delivery, Mr. Alexander Johnston, Deputy Superintendent,
was furnished with a conveyance, and left Canton
on April 3. The 'receiving ships' moved up to the
Bogue, where the entire quantity was handed over to
officers (appointed by the 'Kin-Chae'), who caused it to
be destroyed in deep trenches on Chunpee heights. Thus
'reverent obedience' was shown. Captain Elliot remarked,
in his despatch to her Majesty's Government,
dated March 30, 1839: 'This is the <i>first time, in our</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<i>intercourse with this Empire</i>, that its Government has
taken the <i>unprovoked</i> (?) initiative in aggressive measures
against British <i>life</i>, <i>liberty</i>, and <i>property</i>, and against
the dignity of the British Crown.' No words could more
strongly confirm everything herein said in relation to the
safety of property and life which we had enjoyed at
Canton. But the despatch contained not a word of
the provocation given by foreigners in continuing the
condemned traffic under constantly repeated injunctions
against doing so, and persistent warnings to discontinue
it. I, of course, do not blame my brother
merchants at Canton, no matter to what nation they
belonged, as we were all equally implicated. We disregarded
local orders, as well as those from Pekin,
and really became confident that we should enjoy
perpetual impunity so far as the 'opium trade' was
concerned.</p>

<p>The night of March 24 was one of unusual brilliancy
in its cloudless sky and full moon. The Factories,
forcibly abandoned by several hundred Chinese (estimated
at eight hundred) at a moment's notice, resembled
somewhat places of the dead! Their foreign occupants
were thus left literally in a complete state of destitution
as regards service of any kind, not even a scullion being
allowed to remain. The consequence was that they
were compelled, in order to <i>live</i>, to try their own skill in
cooking, to make up their own rooms, sweep the floors,
lay the table, wash plates and dishes! It may be supposed
that it produced discontent, complaints, and impatience.
Not at all; we in the Suy-Hong&mdash;and it was
the same with our fellow-prisoners in the other Factories,
with few exceptions&mdash;made light of it, and laughed rather
than groaned over the efforts to roast a capon, to boil an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
egg or a potato. We could all clean knives, sweep the
floors, and even manage to fill the lamps. But there were
mysteries which we could not divine; our chief, Mr.
Green, after a vain attempt to boil rice&mdash;which, when
prepared, resembled a tough mass of glue&mdash;proved a
most wretched cook, and took to polishing the silver, but
abandoned that and finally swept the floor! Mr. Low
conscientiously did all he could, but after toasting the
bread to death, and boiling the eggs till they acquired
the consistency of grape-shot, he abandoned that department,
and took to one not exacting so much exercise of
mind, and 'laid the cloth' dexterously and well. The
rest of us, from modesty or a feeling of sheer incapacity,
did no more than was absolutely necessary. It would
have been unfair to rob the others of their laurels!
Some one had to fill the pitchers; anyone could draw a
cork, or even boil water. Thus, by hook or by crook,
we managed to sustain life&mdash;of which the 'bread' was
nightly supplied to us by Houqua's coolies. They also
brought (made up in bags, as if 'personal effects' or
'blankets to keep off the dew,' thus passing the guards)
edibles of all sorts.</p>

<p>During the day we met in the Square, which
became 'High 'Change' of experiences in desperate
efforts to roast, boil, or stew. Some went the length of
considering it great fun; others heaped unheard-of
blessings upon the heads of His Celestial Majesty, Taou-Kwang,
and his envoy 'Lin.'</p>

<p>No two men were so unctuously abused; <i>as if</i> the
vilifiers themselves had always followed strictly the
'Eight Regulations' under which they lived! What
amusement all this created.</p>

<p>By May 2, 15,501 chests had been given up, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the servants were allowed gradually to return, and the
whole quantity, 20,283 chests,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> completed on the 21st.
On the 27th Captain Elliot returned to Macao, and on
the 30th the opium clipper 'Ariel' left for Suez direct
with despatches for the British Government. She returned
on April 2, 1840.</p>

<p>Between May 6 and 21 many foreigners were permitted
to leave the city, and went to Macao or Whampoa.
Captain Elliot, before going himself, on the 22nd
issued a notice to British subjects that they also were
to leave, and by the end of the month they had left;
and there remained no foreigners but Americans, about
twenty-five in number. On the 29th I left with all
books, papers, &amp;c., not actually required at Canton, in
company with six other boats for Macao, containing
Parsees and several English, including Doctors Cox and
Dickson. On the way down we were joined by four
large chop-boats with Messrs. Lindsay &amp; Co.'s establishment,
and John Shillaber and others from Messrs.
Jardine, Matheson, &amp; Co.'s. The trip was most enjoyable;
we dined or passed the day with one another,
and arrived nearly at the same time at Macao on the
night of June 1. The Mandarins who came on board
at Che-Nae and at Heang-Shan were civil as usual,
and seemed perfectly indifferent to what had passed at
Canton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>The surrender of the 'British-owned opium' was
followed by events to which the foreign trade had from
its foundation at Canton been a stranger. Now were
initiated political relations between the vast and unknown
Empire of China and European nations&mdash;the
first that had existed. No treaty had yet been entered
into, except with Russia for regulating its trade and
arranging boundaries. Russian and Chinese commercial
relations had existed between two frontier towns (separated
but by the boundary line) well known as Kiachta
and 'Mae-Mae-Ching.'<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>No Western officer was yet officially recognised, even
of the rank of Consul or Vice-Consul, and all communications
between one or the other and the Canton Government
were through the intermediary of the Co-Hong.
The consequences, therefore, that might grow out of
the delivery of the opium filled the foreign community
with anxiety. The Americans had not delivered any
American-owned opium, of which we held at the time of
surrender about fifty cases of Turkey, but they determined
to remain in the Factories and continue their
business. The English on leaving placed theirs in
charge of the American houses. A large share of it
fell under the control of Russell &amp; Co., and, to facilitate
negotiations with its new constituents outside, one of the
partners opened an office on board the English ship
'Heroine,' at 'Kow-Lung,' and subsequently, when all
foreign vessels were driven away from that anchorage, at
Toon-Koo. Several ships of the firm, including the
'Lintin,' were kept running between these places and
Whampoa with British goods at thirty to forty dollars
per ton, and Indian cotton at seven dollars per bale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
receiving on board no freight unless consigned to the
house. A very active business was carried on under the
American flag, greatly to the convenience of English
friends, as well as to their profit. Teas were the returns
for these inward cargoes, which were brought down to
the anchorage and shipped from Toon-Koo for England.</p>

<p>While the shipments were going on an English vessel
of about 900 tons arrived from Singapore, named the
'Cambridge' under the command of Captain Douglas.
Being offered for sale, she was purchased by Russell
&amp; Co., and her name changed to 'Chesapeake' of
eventful memory. Loaded with British goods, valued
at 150,000<i>l.</i>, with her deck full to the top of the rail,
she was despatched for Whampoa, in charge of Captain
Gilman. She had of course been put under the American
flag. There was very little time to spare, as a
blockade was to commence in a few days. On June 22,
1840, H.M.S. 'Volage,' and subsequently the 'Hyacinth,'
took up their positions off Chunpee<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> at the moment
the 'Chesapeake' sailed by. She was the last vessel
that entered the port. She arrived at her destination
and delivered her cargo, which was landed at Canton in
regular course.</p>

<p>The Chinese had thrown a great raft across the river
just above the second bar, in anticipation of hostilities
with the English. They then thought the best thing to
do was to purchase a large foreign ship, arm and man
her, and anchor her above the raft, as an additional protection
against the barbarian war ships. Application
being made to Mr. Delano, the then chief of Russell
&amp; Co., who had never left Canton, a bargain was concluded
for the 'Chesapeake.' The American flag and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
papers were removed, and she was made over to the
Mandarins. Her 'Cumsha and Measurement' charges,
amounting to about <i>$</i>8,000, were abandoned. The
Mandarins took charge and began to fit her out
as an 'auxiliary defence' to the raft, and thus stop
'English men-of-war' which 'from vainglory or conceit
might dare to attempt the inner waters.' Two great
eyes were painted on her bows. Great streamers hung
from every mast to the deck, a multitude of flags of all
colours and shapes&mdash;bearing such words painted thereon
as 'Courage,' the 'Yang-Yin,' and the 'Pā-Kwa,'<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> together
with the rank of the officer in command&mdash;were
arranged around the taffrail. In short, she became the
Chinese emblem of everything 'mighty and victorious!'
She would strike would-be assailants with consternation
and despair!</p>

<p>Meanwhile her armament was sent on board. Cannon
of every available size were ranged on her two decks;
round shot, stones, and other missiles were accumulated
in quantities; nor were bows and arrows forgotten, nor
quantities of muskets, flint-lock and percussion, and the
more familiar matchlock. Her crew consisted of
Whampoa Chinese (amongst many others)&mdash;these were
accustomed to foreign vessels, and no better sailors than
they&mdash;Manila men, Seedies,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and Lascars, runaways
from country ships. There were probably four or five
hundred men on board.</p>

<p>Thus equipped she was towed down to her appointed
station amidst an inconceivable beating of gongs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
explosion of fire crackers, flying serpents, and fiery
dragons&mdash;thanks to which and her two bow 'eyes' she
arrived in safety and anchored.</p>

<p>This was a few days before February 26, 1841, when
the Bogue Forts were captured by Sir Gordon Bremer.
The 'Unconquerable' was then taking powder on board
in large quantities, packed in jars, which were promiscuously
stowed on deck and between decks, as usual.
She was so engaged also on the 27th, having a great
number of chop-boats and other small craft alongside.
Suddenly appeared the smoke of a steamer approaching
from the Bogue! It turned out to be H.M.'s ship
'Nemesis,' Captain Hall. She had the 'singular audacity
to approach the barrier,' and when within an easy
distance, the 'unheard-of temerity' to try the effect of a
Congreve rocket on the emblem of 'victory and might.'
The aim was true, and like a flash&mdash;or in a 'flash'&mdash;ship,
crew, and contents, boats, all disappeared from the
face of the waters! The explosion was terrific, and was
distinctly heard at Canton, a distance of thirty miles.
Not a human creature was reported to have survived!
For years after there was to be seen on the left bank of
the river the bottom of the ship. It had been separated
from the hull as if sawn off in all its length; and it
gradually disappeared through the combined efforts of
Chinese boatmen, who broke up and carried it piecemeal
away.</p>

<p>The English forces having moved up to Canton, a
suspension of hostilities was agreed upon on March 20,
1841, and the port was again free. Local disturbances,
however, broke out, and, on May 22 following, a mob of
Chinese plundered and burnt down the East India
Company's new Factory, the Dutch, and the Creek. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the 25th, Sir Hugh Gough landed near Pwantingqua's
country house and took possession of the heights
overlooking the city. The authorities then ransomed it
for six millions of dollars, of which five millions were
paid on the 31st, when the forces left Canton and
foreign vessels again entered the port.</p>

<p>The carrying trade on the river now ceased. Lying
in the outer waters we had the 'Lintin,' the 'Lantao'
the 'Lema,' and the 'Ladrone.' The former commenced
her career in China as Russell &amp; Co.'s 'receiving
ship' in 1830. She was well constructed to carry a
large cargo, and her sailing qualities were fair. Her
career and ultimate fate were singular. With the exception
of shifting stations during the taiphoon seasons,
her anchors were never raised for nine years, when in
1839, as related, she resumed her original vocation of
a sailing ship up and down the 'Pearl' River.</p>

<p>During this state of idleness for our ships, I received
information from Mr. Delano that Houqua was disposed
to send orders to India for cotton. Prices had
naturally fallen there during the blockade and troubles
at Canton, while the non-importation for several months
had caused a great rise. Three of the ships were despatched
and 100,000<i>l.</i> remitted to Calcutta, Bombay,
and Madras. The funds were in East India Company's
bills on Calcutta. The 'Lintin' sailed for
Madras, the 'Lantao' for Calcutta, and the 'Lema'
for Bombay, thus securing so much tonnage for the
cotton, while other vessels were to be chartered at
those ports. The first vessel, however, that arrived
with a portion of the purchases was the Swedish
ship 'Calcutta,' and she had anchored in the Taypa
only a few days when she was driven on shore in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
taiphoon. In due time our own ships arrived. The
'Lintin' was then despatched a second time, but got no
further than Singapore, when her captain, Townsend,
in direct breach of orders, and under various pretexts,
took in a cargo of rattans and returned to Macao! His
'accounts' being refused, he brought an action against
us in the Macao court.</p>

<p>It was still going on when I left Macao in 1844.
The legal papers had so accumulated that they seemed
sufficient to 'dunnage' the ship. Asking the clerk of
the court one day if he thought it would <i>ever</i> be settled,
he made the same reply that he had repeated for years:
'Se senhor, mā, hum poco tiempŏ!' ('Certainly, sir, but
it requires a little time').</p>

<p>The 'Lintin,' however, was sent to Whampoa. The
first English treaty with the Chinese having been
broken, further preparations were made for defence, and
the authorities, not discouraged, sought for another
foreign ship&mdash;this time for service nearer the city. They
took a fancy to the 'Lintin;' she was sold to them, and
towed up the river by a great fleet of small boats. An
eye<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> was painted on each bow; she was completely
unrigged to her lower masts, and, amidst a confused
noise of gongs and fireworks, she was anchored just
below the Dutch Folly, opposite the city.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for 'making her over' various
high Mandarins with many followers came on board.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Captain Endicott, who was in charge, had caused
certain refreshments to be laid out on the cabin table
with which to regale these officers. They consisted of
several junk bottles of gin and brandy, a jug or two
of water, hard biscuits and cheroots! Before accompanying
them over the ship, he invited them to the cabin.</p>

<p>As he said when relating the circumstance to us,
'after drinks all round and a weed' we returned on
deck to look about the vessel; next we visited the between-decks,
and the Mandarins pronounced everything highly
satisfactory. Seeing a Scuttle-Butt<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> pump, it attracted the
attention of one of them, who took it to be an 'engine
of war,' and asked to be informed as to the manner of
its use! They soon after took leave and returned to
the city. 'Thank heaven,' said Captain Endicott to a
gentleman whom he had asked on board to see the
Chinese officials, 'that's over; now that they are off, let
us go down and take a drink and a smoke.' On
getting to the cabin they found that <i>everything</i>&mdash;the
gin and brandy, cigars, biscuits, even the water-jug,
pitcher, and tumblers&mdash;had all been walked off with
by the followers of the high dignitaries! A Chinese
crew and naval Mandarin took possession, as Captain
Endicott pulled away from his 'old home' for so many
years. She was then duly turned into a Chinese man-of-war.
There were the usual insignia of invincibility,
triangular flags, on which were figures of dragons
swallowing the moon, the 'Yin and Yang,' circles and
zigzag lines, emblematical of thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>The commanding officer of all this destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
paraphernalia, with the peacock's feather in his cap, a
large silk umbrella held over his head, seated himself
comfortably in a bamboo chair, smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>Other formidable preparations for war were duly
made in a provision of worm-eaten guns, matchlocks,
spears, and shields. She would soon have been ready
for an encounter with any of the English sloops, whether
the 'Modeste' or the 'Algerine,' perhaps even the
'Herald;' but one night a great freshet took place.
The violence of the tide was such that she swerved at
her anchor from right to left, struck on the rocks close
to the 'Folly,' slid off, and went down in deep water!
The Chinese then set to work and unshipped her masts,
leaving a stump of the foremast about seven feet above
the deck, and placed upon it a diminutive lantern. This
served thenceforth as a 'lighthouse' to guide boats up
and down the river! It was the <i>first</i> lighthouse in
Canton waters 'on record.' When I last saw the stump
of the mast, twenty-eight years after, a great bank of
mud had formed around the hull, and a faint glimmer
from a penny dip in a small paper lantern marked
the last resting-place of the 'Lintin.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The seizure of the opium in its consequences was <i>the</i>
feature in the breaking up of the exclusive conditions of
foreign trade at Canton, as it had existed since 1720.
The peculiar conditions also of social life were doomed,
as was that perfect and wonderful organisation, the
Co-Hong.</p>

<p>On August 10, 1841, Sir Henry Pottinger arrived at
Macao as Her Majesty's sole plenipotentiary and Minister
Extraordinary. Negotiations with the Mandarins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were carried on simultaneously with the capture of
cities on the coast. The material losses and destruction
of life to the Chinese were incalculable, particularly
through suicide by those helpless people. An English
officer who was present at the taking of Chā-Po in May
1842 wrote to a friend at Macao that on landing, about
3,500 strong, under cover of the men-of-war, the most
terrible enormities were committed. He then goes on to
say: 'After the city had been captured, I entered more
than a hundred houses, and in each there were not less
than two, and in many eight, persons found dead. They
were the bodies of mothers and daughters who had
committed suicide from a dread of becoming prisoners;
1,600 dead were buried after the battle, of which more
than one-half were Tartar soldiers, who in despair of
repelling the enemy, and preferring death to defeat, had
<i>nearly all</i> destroyed themselves. Is not this a splendid
exhibition of patriotism?'</p>

<p>The losses of the English on this occasion by the
official accounts were one colonel, one sergeant, and
seven men killed, seven officers and forty-seven men
wounded; and so on to the end, the pigmy against the
giant!</p>

<p>At length the treaty of Nanking, in which the
Chinese consented to pay an indemnity of <i>$</i>21,000,000,
was signed off that city, on board of H.M.S. 'Cornwallis,'
on August 29, 1842, by his Excellency Sir Henry
Pottinger, the Imperial Commissioners Ke-Ying and
E-Leepoo, and New-Keen, the Viceroy of Keang-Nan and
Keang-Se. And thus concluded the first European war
with China, one of the most unjust ever waged by one
nation against another.</p>

<p>The next treaty was that of the United States, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was signed at the village of Mong-Hā (Macao) on
July 3, 1844, by Mr. Caleb Cushing and Ke-Ying. Together
they were the 'knell, the shroud, the mattock,
and the grave' of Old Canton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Chinese had not looked with satisfaction upon
the concessions they had been obliged to make to an overwhelming
military and naval force, which had caused
them the loss of myriads of lives, often under circumstances
of great atrocity, of unheard-of suffering, as well
as of many millions of dollars independently of the war
indemnity. The ordeal was a terrible one; but they
gained by it the, to them, unenvied <i>privilege</i> of falling in
with Western ideas. Encouraged by the confidence inspired
by so <i>great</i> a <i>privilege</i>, they now contract for loans
of money, they build vessels of war on European models,
and drill their soldiers in foreign tactics; they provide
themselves with Western arms of precision&mdash;in short,
they are putting on their armour. They are in full career
of a diplomacy in which Ambassadors or Ministers&mdash;that
is to say, 'spies upon one another'&mdash;watch over the
interests of their respective countries. With the sword
at their throat they have become members of what is
facetiously called the 'Brotherhood' of Nations!</p>

<h2>MESSRS. RUSSELL &amp; CO., CANTON.</h2>

<div class="center">1823 TO 1844.</div>


<p>The house of Russell &amp; Co. was constituted on January 1,
1824, in succession to that of Samuel Russell &amp; Co., which had
existed from December 26, 1818, to December 26, 1823. It
is known amongst the Chinese as 'Kee-Chang-Hong.' It
confined itself strictly to agency business. From January 1,
1824, until the middle of 1830 the sole partners were Mr.
Russell and Philip Ammidon. In September 1829 Mr. Wm. H.
Low arrived from Salem in the ship 'Sumatra' (Captain
Roundy); and in November 1830 Mr. Augustine Heard, Senior,
arrived from Boston in the bark 'Lintin' (Captain R. B. Forbes).
These two gentlemen (Mr. Low and Mr. Heard) became
partners in the house, the first until the end of the year 1833,
when, having been obliged to leave Canton from ill health, he
was landed and died at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>During the term of 1834-5-6, consequent upon the death
of Mr. Low, were admitted Mr. John C. Green (special agent
at Canton of Messrs. N. L. and G. Griswold, of New York),
Mr. John M. Forbes, who had arrived in the 'Lintin' to join
the office in 1830, and Mr. Joseph Coolidge, who arrived in
1832; and Mr. Heard retired.</p>

<p>The term of 1837-8-9 saw the withdrawal of Messrs. Forbes
and Coolidge, the first on December 31, 1838, and the latter
on December 31, 1839. Were admitted on January 1, 1837,
Mr. A. A. Low (nephew of Mr. W. H. Low), who had come
out to join the office in 1833), and Mr. W. C. Hunter. Mr.
Edward King (who came out in the 'Silas Richards,' Captain
Rosseter, 1834), was taken in the office on arrival, and became
a partner on July 1, 1837; Mr. Robert B. Forbes (who arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in the 'Bashaw' in October 1838) was admitted January 1,
1839, and became the chief of the house.</p>

<p>The term of 1840-41-42, Mr. A. A. Low having retired,
began with the admission of Mr. Warren Delano (formerly of
the house of Russell, Sturgis, &amp; Co., of Canton and Manila).
He succeeded Mr. Forbes as chief of the house when the
latter left for New York in the 'Niantic' on July 7, 1840.
Mr. Russell Sturgis, also a former partner of Russell, Sturgis,
&amp; Co., became a partner on January 1, 1842. Mr. King and
Mr. Hunter retired on December 31, 1842, left Macao in February
1844 for New York, <i>viâ</i> the Cape (in the ship 'Akbar,'
Captain Hallet), and the retirement of Mr. Sturgis took place
on December 31, 1843.</p>

<p>This is but a rapid <i>résumé</i> of an interval of twenty years.
A history of the house from its foundation to the present time&mdash;a
period of sixty years&mdash;has been compiled by a former partner.
The work, which would prove of interest to its many friends,
its old associates, and their successors, may be published.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE.</h2>

<p>Just a Cycle ago, a gentleman came on board the ship
'Citizen,' as she anchored at Lintin, China, from New York, to
hear the <i>latest</i> news she may have brought&mdash;125 days old!&mdash;the
interval was a short one at that time.</p>

<p>Such as Canton <i>then</i> was in its commercial, social, and
domestic life it has been for two generations a sealed book; nor
will the world ever see its like again! May those who <i>now</i>
seek China Opened be as well received, as little molested,
as much protected, as were those over whom the ægis of
treaties never existed, and as bountifully rewarded as those
whose enterprise led them to what was <i>then</i> a 'mysterious
land.'</p>

<p>It is <i>now</i>, through the untiring encouragement and assistance
of the gentleman above referred to (and who will, I trust,
excuse my naming him)&mdash;Robert B. Forbes, Esq., of Boston,

the Portuguese first approached it, about 1525, the strong resemblance of
the red sandstone eminence to the left of the narrow mouth of the Pearl

signifies 'head manager.' The assistants or clerks were called 'pursers.'
This word was undoubtedly taken from the office of 'purser,' whom the
Chinese had only known as transacting business for the commanders of the
East India Company's ships. The latter enjoyed the privilege of forty tons
of space (English measurement) in each vessel homeward, which involved
the presence at Canton of the 'pursers' to act for them in selling their
outward and buying their homeward investments. The 'pursers' frequently
hired a portion of a Factory (when to be had), and resided in it more or less
while their ships were at Whampoa.</p></div>

he never hinted that he was not its sole founder. If my memory serves
me Sir James was at the time on a trip up the coast. Nevertheless there
is but one 'old Canton' who can decide the point, the present Sir
Alexander Matheson.</p></div>

is very far from the fact. The bows of sea-going junks represent the head
of a <i>dragon</i>, with expanded jaws and full round eyes, and being the

an American vessel, without occult power attaching thereto.</p></div>
